        "O objetivo deste trabalho é aplicar técnicas de aprendizado não supervisionado para analisar e agrupar dados de avaliações de filmes e dados socioeconômicos de países, utilizando os algoritmos K-means e DBSCAN. No contexto das avaliações de filmes, aplicaremos o K-means para agrupar as avaliações com base na polaridade dos sentimentos expressos, utilizando dados da Stanford Sentiment Treebank e a biblioteca TextBlob para análise de sentimentos. Além disso, utilizaremos o DBSCAN para identificar e categorizar países com base em fatores como renda, PIB, investimento em saúde e expectativa de vida, destacando aqueles que mais necessitam de apoio socioeconômico. Tendo como motivação demonstrar a eficácia desses algoritmos na identificação de padrões ocultos e na categorização de grandes conjuntos de dados, fornecendo insights importantes sem a necessidade de rótulos pré-definidos.\n",

Anxiety increased by having read Buscemi's fairly harrowing account of making the film in one of those 'The Directors' books.<br /><br />Shouldn't have worried. Great flick. Totally engrossing, especially to a *cough* former *cough* barfly like myself. Beautifully understated, funny, very sad, nicely paced and Buscemi very wisely NOT trying to dominate every scene, although he certainly dominates the movie.<br /><br />Movie appears on first sight plot less but actually it isn't at all: Buscemi's search for a second chance to escape from the morass of his own making is riveting. Everyone involved seems to have had a good time and the beautifully relaxed performances are the reward. Only the two knucklehead goombahs fall below the otherwise uniformly excellent level.<br /><br />A real treat, and thoroughly watchable-again able. My DVD was in TV format, which sucked, but otherwise the low budget doesn't really intrude.<br /><br />Nearest movie to it I can think of offhand is KILLING OF A Chinese BOOKIE. Radically different subject matter but similar bittersweet texture.<br /><br />A slightly, but only slightly, generous 9/10 from me.\n",

Frank Whaley always looked strained trying to get his part right, while Ethan appeared relaxed and natural. That's the difference between a want-a-be and an outstanding actor. The high light of the movie was when Ethan Hawke, playing an inept grocery store stocking clerk, kept dumping his load of boxes off the dolly. The part played by Whaley was of a loser want-a-be stand-up comic who could not make the grade and was never funny. The pathetic Whaley character was a thief (stole from his employer), drunk (what he stole was beer), argumentative individual (couldn't hold a job), and general misfit. As to the movie itself, it was a drag, repetitive in its plot with only the local changing. In other words, the plot was recycled every few minutes. In general slow and predictable, a bore to watch, and if you haven't seen it yet, don't waste your time.\n",

            "It's nice that this film exists, but as it stands it's a major disappointment. Director Leslie Hiscott and cinematographers Sydney Blythe and William Luff get some nice proto-noir compositions into the first and last reels, but in between it's a very claustrophobic movie that seems to take place entirely indoors, either in the home of Ronald Adair or in Sherlock Holmes' and Dr. Watson's digs at 221B Baker Street. We know the film is set in 1930 instead of the 1890's because Holmes deduces that Watson is having trouble with his car, but we never see any cars  or much action of any kind. It's just eight reels of dull, ill-paced talk (where was Alfred Hitchcock when they needed him? Actually working at a bigger, more prestigious British studio than Twickenham!), sloppily recorded by Baynham Honri, who for some reason gets an on-screen credit in type as big as the director's. And though I usually respect the critical judgments of the late William K. Everson  who said Arthur Wontner was one of the two best actors ever to play Holmes  he's never convinced me in the role. He's perfectly adequate in the scenes showing Holmes as a cerebral \"armchair detective\" but utterly wrong for the neurotic man of action Sir Arthur Conan Doyle also intended Holmes to be. But then to me (to paraphrase the opening of the Conan Doyle Holmes story \"A Scandal in Bohemia\") Basil Rathbone (who looked uncannily like the Sidney Paget illustrations for the original Holmes stories and did both the cerebral and the active sides of the character consummately well) will always be THE Sherlock Holmes.\n",

            "In a bland, sterile, heavily automated future where dying from terminal illness has become virtually obsolete, the fact that best-selling writer Katherine Mortenhoe (a fabulously fiery, feisty turn by Romy Schneider) has a rare mortal sickness that will bring about her untimely demise makes her a prime subject for a tasteless mondo-style live atrocity TV show. But the fiercely proud and self-sufficient Katherine refuses to prostitute her impending death into a hideous spectacle for a jaded audience's sick enjoyment. So amoral, opportunistic director Vincent (a sleazily appealing Harry Dean Stanton), the man responsible for the lurid, top-rated \"Death Watch\" series, has cameras implanted behind the eyes of eager beaver reporter Roddy (the one and only Harvey Keitel, who's excellent as usual). Roddy befriends the unsuspecting Katherine and secretly records her final days in all their ghastly intimacy.<br /><br />Directed in a crisp, low-key, thoughtful manner by Bertrand Taverneir, with a lucid, intelligent, provocative script by Taverneir and David Rayfiel, sumptuous, prowling, appropriately voyeuristic cinematography by Pierre William Glenn, a beautifully melancholy tone, a frantic screaming violins classical music score by Antoine Duhamel, a deliberately gradual pace, and a lovely cameo by Max Von Sydow as Katherine's wise, reclusive schoolteacher father, this eerily prophetic and gravely philosophical film ruminates on a compelling variety of very timely and topical post-modern issues: technological advancements making it easier to invade a person's privacy and causing creativity to stagnate (Katherine's novels are actually written by a computer that she strictly programs ideas into), technology overwhelming mankind so greatly that it causes people to become unfeeling, dispassionate automatons, the morbidly irresistible allure of real life tragedy, man's denial of his own mortality, journalistic ethics, dying with your dignity intact, even fate vs. free will. A brilliant, moving, and most accomplished thinking man's science fiction gem.\n",

            "I was lucky enough to go to a small screening of FOD at my college. Randy Olson was present at the end to discuss opinions and answer questions.<br /><br />What struck me about this movie was how unashamedly it looks at pretension and ego in the scientific community today. Though ostensibly about the Evolution vs. Intelligent Design debate, this movie delves quite deeply into the levels of effective communication between scientist and layman. Anyone out there who's ever studied under a particularly brilliant professor will know exactly what I mean- they usually have quite earth-shatteringly amazing ideas and thoughts that they are woefully unequipped to communicate to the rest of us mortals.<br /><br />The movie covers the Evolution/ID debate (and its theological implications) from a variety of perspectives, ranging from Conservative right-wingers to Athiest Liberals. To be entirely honest, I went in to see this movie with a preexisting bias- I am a student of Evolution and an Athiest. However, what I like about this movie is that it does not hide or suppress the opinions of either side, but lets them be heard. While my opinion on Evolution remains unchanged, this movie did uproot some prejudices in my mind relating to certain very common social stereotypes. Fundamentalist Christians are not necessarily scary bible-spouting messengers of doom, nor are scientists with an arsenal of PhDs necessarily the calm voice of reason.<br /><br />Ultimately, Flock of Dodos is precise, to the point, and in a way- manages to do exactly what it asks the scientific community to do. It communicates a complex idea to the everyman without resorting to falsification or 'dumbing-down.' (9*/10*)\n",

            "Then this would be the last before last seduction, right? It will happen, I am positively sure. But what about this movie? Apparently it is bad if you have seen The Last Seduction PERIOD. I did not see that original and must say that I was pleasantly surprised by number II. I am convinced that it is in a entirely different vein, it is probably more a parody than a follow-up. I felt well entertained and often quite amused.<br /><br />Is this a good bad movie? Definitely! The action is supposed to take place mainly in Barcelona, Spain. But the movie makers had to make do mainly with Cardiff, Wales, Great Britain. So do not expect a presentation of the more glamorous parts of the capital of Catalonia in this movie, the place seems to be populated mainly by Brits here. The storyline is a little sketchy, but where it is unconvincing it adds to the hilarious overall atmosphere. And there really is quite some (intentionally) funny dialog, several good and quick verbal exchanges and a pretty elaborately laid out credit card scam angle which already is of a certain historical value.<br /><br />This certainly is a movie whose cast is above the material. The majority of the actors and actresses are British, and they know their trade. The male lead is very convincing as sleazy wannabe gangster boss with a low I.Q. Joan Severance is pretty much the only American in the cast, she puts the right amount of irony into her performance  and she really has extremely long legs. There is also some great support by Spanish bit players (the Spanish sounds at times a bit shaky, though  but what else can you expect in Cardiff?).<br /><br />The Last Seduction II may also be pleasant to watch for feminists. The two leading female parts order the macho guys around pretty much and are mostly on top. The most funny scene for me was a simple extreme long shot of Severance and the male leading part walking down a street side by side. The man is more than a full head shorter than his companion and although in full macho regalia he looks rumpled and thoroughly miserable.<br /><br />Believe it or not  except for some unnecessary violence I can recommend this movie.\n",

            "This was one of my favorite films at the Santa Fe Film Festival. Director Connell presents us with a broad cast of dreamers and misfits. His sympathetic look at these ambitious and under-appreciated performers is moving and genuine.<br /><br />As a person who has been knocking at Hollywood's doors for years I found myself a little frustrated by the film -- are my dreams folly? -- but ultimately the message of the film has nothing to do with the sometimes ridiculous ambitions of its struggling protagonists but more with the importance of pursuing a dream, come what may. <br /><br />I was encouraged once to find out what I was crazy about and pursue it like a madman. Strictly Background shows us a group of die-hards who are doing just that - and their determination is inspiring. <br /><br />The movie will also change the way you watch movies. After watching the film it takes a long time to watch a movie without noticing the background -- is that a good thing? Sure, there are no parts that do not contribute to the whole.\n",

            "There was barely a minute in the Circus I wasn't smiling and/or laughing like a silly little kid, and that's the key for how successful the picture is and, hopefully, in its appeal. For those handful of young people (i.e. children) who would be adventurous enough to come close to a black and white movie let alone one without any dialog, it's possibly the most enjoyable of all of Chaplin's pre-1940 work. This doesn't mean it'll make you cry like City Lights or be somewhat enlightened like Modern Times, but it has a fresh and joyous and innocent delight in its making and Chaplin as the Little Tramp, where here he's more than ever like a simple cartoon character thrust into this rough-and-tumble circus world with a mean ringmaster and kind and kind of loving girl.<br /><br />And it's not just the infamous climactic tightrope act, although if for no other reason that's one big reason to see the film as the little Tramp goes haywire with his plans to \"safely\" go across the tightrope. It's just the entire assemblage of skits and moments, little things that might seem silly to talk about- like Chaplin locked in a lion's cage or trying to 'learn' a barber trick- and how it unfolds with a precision and finesse (yes, finesse) that is just short of genius, if not that. In fact a big point in the film is \"try and act funny\", which is not something that can really be barked on command to anyone, especially the Little Tramp who, in essence, garners his comedy from unintentional goofiness, embarrassment or humiliation on the parts of others, or just plain old physical pratfalls. What we get in the Circus is the tale of the classic clown in the midst of a whole programmed slew of them, and what it takes to make it in it- or what humanity is there.<br /><br />As said, it doesn't necessarily have the best love story, even if that's touching, and it doesn't make some big statement on the working-man or society in general. But if you want to just flat-out laugh at some incredible stunts and witness Chaplin's craft of quality, The Circus is fantastic fun.\n",

            "I have watched all of Red Dwarf many times since I was little and always found it funny especially series 4-6. I loved the adventures they got in. The characters were brilliant too. The female Holly was much better and more stupid than the annoying bloke version. Every character had their funny moments. The main part of this review is to complain about series 7 and 8. They stink ferociously. There is no easier way to put it. I was hopeful after the first episode as that was quite good although still a little overdone with that annoying cinema effect they used but then in the next few episodes, Rimmer left and they brought Kochanski into the show. Not the original one played by Claire Grogan but the woman from Crime Traveller. She RUINED the show. Repeat: SHE RUINED THE SHOW. Her character was rubbish. Interacted with the rest of the cast badly and was NEVER funny. I was hoping every episode that she would leave but as she mysteriously appeared in the opening sequence I knew that would never happen. Along with that, Kryten completely changed. He went from Smart Alec android to some sort of whiny complaining love sick robot who over night developed a crush on Lister. I hated how the show was so serious. It's a sitcom not a drama. Star Trek had more humour than this. I was 10 when I anticipated this series and was genuinely looking forward to it. A few episodes later I was annoyed at school when everyone kept quoting it and saying it was really funny. It wasn't!!! For Series 8 I think they knew 7 had been too serious so they tried to make it funny again but they went too far and it turned into some sort of Benny Hill like slapstick, camp romp with stupid one liners and the addition of some awful actors along with Captain Hollister. Resurrecting the crew was a stupid BAD idea. The acting went down hill too. The episode with Canaries had \"Bulla\" from the 11 'o clock show. 8 had a very cheap n nasty flavour too it. I'm glad it ended when it did. I think it went crap because Rob Grant stopped writing and left Doug Naylor on his own. That and the 4 year time gap between 6 and 7. That said, the first six series are BRILLIANT\n",

            "The first line of dialogue in this indie short is Batman saying \"Not a good idea\" and that accurately sums up the whole project. The original concept, writing and approach to the character in 'The Death of Batman' are not good ideas and, in fact, the entire short is a extremely bad idea. This short has nothing to do with the other fan-based indie shorts, 'Batman: Dead End,' 'World's Finest,' and 'Grayson,' which are essentially mock-up trailers for films that fans would like to see developed and are intended for presentation at comic conventions. Whereas those three shorts are created out of a spirit of fanboy reverence and earnest enthusiasm for superhero movies, 'The Death of Batman' feels like it was made by a person expressing severe angst toward the concept of the superhero. I hesitate to use the word disturbing to describe this short because that word suggests an emotional impact that a skilled filmmaker could achieve, in the way a horror movie or an art film can be both disturbing and rewarding. 'The Death of Batman' is disturbing without being rewarding in the slightest. I think I understand what the director had intended; Batman as a Christ-figure (the short's last image is a stained-glass image of Jesus). So the less-than brilliant rationale for this indie short appears to be that for the Dark Knight to work, cinematically, as a Christ-figure he must be brutally tortured and die. The director seems focused on every type of taboo that could never make it into a studio superhero movie, such as having the hero tortured, sexually assaulted and then pointlessly killed with a heroin overdose. Personally I like a darker Gotham than most and I have imagined what an R-rated Batman movie might be like, however 'The Death of Batman' is unrewarding even in simply seeing it as a for-adults superhero story because all of its extremeness and shock value is all it has to offer. This short is nothing more than somebody's perverse imagining of Batman's death with no redeeming character insight and a failed Christ comparison. This is not a funny short, as others on this sit have suggested - it is not amusing or entertaining or even thought-provoking.<br /><br />If you are someone who cares about the character of Batman, this short is only an upsetting and angering experience Do yourself a favor, DO NOT WATCH THIS SHORT. I don't mean that as in a trekkie telling you not to watch 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' because it fails to meet certain expectations or do not watch 'Batman & Robin' because it's a waste of time, I mean that if you watch this short could ruin Batman for you. I wish I had never seen it.\n",

I have to say, this movie reminded me of Madeleine. However, this Romance movie was quite unusual. It wasn't boring, and yet, there was no solid resolution.

            "Many of IMDb's favorable reviews of \"Saturn 3\" begin with \"This movie scared the wits out of me when I was ten,\" or something of the sort. These reviews are always favorable. I suspect that these members' recent viewings are tinged with nostalgia. At any rate, here's a review based on an adult's first viewing.<br /><br />Much of this review focuses on the means used to bring the film's main physical threat, a robot named Hector, to the screen. This stems from the fact that the entire second half of \"Saturn 3\" is a simple monster movie: Hero saves passive woman from monster. Hero and passive woman run from monster. Hero kills monster. For any of this to be worth your time, the monster has to be scary. Hector--a pencil-necked, wobbling, clumsy, slow-coach stunt-guy-in-a-suit--is not scary.<br /><br />\"Saturn 3\"'s budget woes are well-documented. While they don't show up in its cast or set design, they do betray themselves in other ways. The biggest single problem is Hector. Hector is a guy in a robot suit. It's a cumbersome suit, tricked out with fluid-filled surgical tubes and rigid metal plates. In an ineffective attempt to persuade viewers that it isn't a guy in a suit, the suit's designers built up its shoulders so high that they enveloped the guy's head. They then stuck Hector's own \"head\" atop it. The \"head\" is an extremely fragile concoction, with two light-bulb \"eyes\" at the end of a miniature desk lamp arm. It's so fragile that, when it moves, the whole assembly shakes unevenly.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this means that when the script calls for the monster to stare, frighteningly, at the audience, the camera must zoom in on this stupid, fragile head and lavish attention on it. And that, my friends, is a giggle-inducing moment. It undercuts any remaining credibility this robot has as a threat. Instead, it establishes Hector as a pencil-necked geek. Through the rest of the film, whenever I saw Kirk Douglas struggling for his life with Hector. I wondered: \"Why don't you just reach up and snap Hector's tiny little neck? He'll be left blind, and you can hunt him down at your leisure.\"<br /><br />We have plenty of time to wonder about this, because Hector is slooowww. That's because, after all, he's a guy in a cumbersome robot suit. Moreover, it's clear that Hector's mind isn't the only thing that's dangerously unbalanced; the suit is on the verge of toppling over more than once.<br /><br />By the time Kirk Douglas sacrifices himself to destroy Hector, you're so distant from the story that you notice, immediately, that he didn't need to kill himself in order to pull off the trick that kills Hector. It's a trope designed to manipulate the audience, divorced from reason and bereft of emotional impact.<br /><br />My score of 3/10 reflects Kirk Douglas' reliable work and the rather good set design. The sets are very effective in evoking a dark and claustrophobic mood, and with their vein-like tubes they quite plausibly represent a biological research station carved from lunar rock. The missing seven points are due to the risible robot, Harvey Keitel's wooden acting (perhaps aggravated by his unknown dubber), and shoddy visual effects (even for the period). To be fair, the VFX serve only to establish locations; but this _is_ science fiction. VFX are part of the draw, and they need to be at least serviceable.\n",

            "Cinderella III is by far the best Disney movie to be the final chapter in a trilogy. Most of the sequels and \"final chapters\" never have the chance to hold their own and try to be at least as good as the first, but this movie does it. We see the Stepmother turn more wicked than she was in the first film after she gets the wand. We see which step-sister is actually ugly and wicked. Anastasia's character really shines in this film. Though watching and dealing with Cinderella's newest problem, you also watch, laugh, and cry with Anastasia. You truly see what's in her heart and how she feels. I love the way she progresses and shows that though someone may come from a family of cold black hearts, that one person can still be warm and caring on the inside if given the chance. The Prince is given a new look on how sweet and kind he actually is and why he's \"Prince Charming\". The mice are lovable as always and almost even more and of course, Cinderella our Heroin... this movie deserves to be watched with an open mind. Yes, go and remember how the original story goes, but do not expect it to be as sugar coated, Cinderella III is for one that everyone will enjoy. When magic's involved... all bets are off.\n",

            "This movie's only redeeming features are the moments when you cant help laughing out loud at the overblown clichés. Such as when Arn is sad and riding through the rain. Or when Cecila is happy and starts to dance. Or every time Joakim Netterkvist makes his \"sad puppy\" face, or whenever the dramatic string orchestra starts playing. On the plus side this happens a lot. <br /><br />On the minus side, the rest of the time it just hurts to watch it. You feel sorry for everyone involved, especially those who paid for it. Everybody, the actors, the director, the editor, seems to be nervous working on such a big budget project (the most expensive Swedish film ever) and scared to make mistakes, and this total lack of confidence shines through everywhere.<br /><br />Impossible though it seems, this actually makes the books look good in comparison. Hell, it makes Kingdom of Heaven seem good. And that is quite an achievement.\n",

            "This feature, as you probably gathered, largely centres around Snoopy, Charlie Brown's dog.<br /><br />Charlie Brown has been becoming ever more resentful of Snoopy's recent independence (in particular going to the beach to spend time with Peppermint Patty), and, after cutting his thumb while trying to open his can of dog-food, he gives Snoopy a scolding and makes him feel guilty and worthless.<br /><br />The following day, when Snoopy tries to go to the beach to see Peppermint Patty again as promised, suddenly a sign has been put up saying that dogs are not allowed on the beach. This starts a chain reaction that begins a string of frustration within Snoopy...<br /><br />More snubbing comes from other members of the Peanuts gang when what started off as being a bit of fun with Linus and his security blanket soon turns sadistic and nasty, once again with Snoopy on the losing end.<br /><br />Snoopy then has a bit of fun with Linus' elder sister Lucy, who is using boxing gloves, and they have a bit of a light-hearted spar, but again Snoopy pushes things that little bit too far and ends up upsetting Lucy and she spits the dummy at him.<br /><br />Shortly afterwards, Snoopy receives a letter from a mysterious girl named Lila, who is in hospital and for some reason craves his presence. Snoopy and his bird friend Woodstock (making his animated film debut here) suddenly set off to meet her. Their journey is plagued by quite a few of the famous 'No dogs allowed'-type signs, which again do little to heighten the spirits of our favourite beagle!<br /><br />Eventually, however, Snoopy and Woodstock reach the hospital where Lila is staying, and her spirit does indeed rise when the dog suddenly appears by her bedside and enriches her enthusiasm. However, little does Snoopy know that she will practically coax her into doing something that will really tug at his heart-strings...<br /><br />I first saw this film as a boy in my early tens, and even when I watch it now it has lost none of its ability to endear and -- in particular -- choke. There is one particular section that still makes me cry to this day at a party for Snoopy, where poor Charlie Brown is just too choked to say anything. Even just THINKING about that scene induces tears...<br /><br />As a whole, though, the film is enjoyable fare. It's not a classic, but it's still memorable, and has some actually quite good songs that are not in the least bit intrusive and only add to the overall charm. There is also some spot humour, much of which is caused by Woodstock's erratic flying and Snoopy's constantly being taunted by the 'No dogs allowed' signs permating his venture.<br /><br />Recommended, but don't expect your eyes to be anything other than moist at some point in the film!\n",

While the plot is a trifle flat, and a couple of the supporting actors (Victoria Tennent) stretch their abilities, the cinematographic techniques and direction by John Frankenheimer are superb, and Caine and Lilli Palmer are absolutely wonderful. The elements of film, particularly outdoor angles from crowded streets and icy violin sound effects echo back to the great spy movies of the Cold War era and lend an almost Hitchcockesque eeriness. The seedy Berlin night life is not overly useful and a bit tawdry, but it passes as just a spicy interlude. And when the climax finally reveals the plot, even the dense can see the implications and relevance to contemporary events in the 21st Century.<br /><br />Frankenheimer puts on a great show!\n",

This film makes clear how dreadful daily life was in Taliban ruled Afghanistan, particularly if you were a female (not that it's much fun in other Muslim countries) and we quickly sympathise with the central characters in their struggle for survival. That it was made only a year after the Taliban were ousted gives it an authentic documentary feel, but it would still be as effective if the events were years earlier. Part of the fascination is how the Taliban managed to be so primitive and backward (basically anything that didn't exist at the time the Koran was written was verboten, with the exception of weapons and vehicles for them to get around in) and the peculiarities of Islamic attitudes and practices that distinguished the Taliban from, for example, the Khymer Rouge in Cambodia or the Nazis in Germany, although there are also parallels.\n",

            "The worst kind of movie sequel promotes a supporting character to take over the lead role and takes longer than a couple of years to arrive in theatres. Like \"The Return of Josey Wales,\" \"Iron Eagle 2,\" \"Smoky and the Bandit 3,\" and \"Jaws 3 & 4,\" the latest superficial sequel to show up, \"Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj,\" substitutes a supporting character for the title protagonist and appears four years later. As far as gross-out comedies go, \"National Lampoon's Van Wilder\" (2002) was no masterpiece, but the Ryan Reynolds' original qualified as far funnier that its tardy and tedious sequel could ever imagine. Everything that made Kal Penn of \"Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle\" so memorable in the first \"Van Wilder\" has been sacrificed and Penn cannot rival Reynolds' comic timing. Not only does it lack Reynolds' charismatic poise, but also the uninspired plot rehashes hackneyed higher education humor that \"Animal House,\" \"Revenge of the Nerds,\" \"Old School,\" and \"Porky's\" have already worn out. Like its predecessor, \"Van Wilder 2\" does feature a collegiate setting, several bare-breasted babes, binge drinking aplenty, risqué sexual epithets, with a scatological skit or two, but nothing like the crude shenanigans in the first movie. The two biggest jokes in \"Van Wilder\" consisted of the seamstress sight gag at the beginning and then the very vulgar prank where a rival fraternity gobble pastries spiked with the seminal fluids of a well-endowed bulldog. The lack of anything remotely funny is compounded by the lack of originality in \"Van Wilder 2.\" Look for this lackluster movie to crowd the video shelves in no time.<br /><br />Baby-faced comic Ryan Reynolds channeled Chevy Chase in \"Van Wilder,\" but the eponymous hero graduated from Coolidge College after seven year of lolly gagging. As Van Wilder's Indian protégé Taj Mahal Badalandabad, Kal Penn has not only stepped into his mentor's shoes but also he has stepped into something infinitely worse--a movie of unmitigated mediocrity. Nobody quite knows how to pronounce Taj's family name in \"Van Wilder 2\" and the joke generates fewer laughs with each instance. Freshman scenarist David Drew Gallagher, who has acted in a number of television shows and should forsake the pen, has forged far fewer offensive gags than his rowdy predecessors in his cookie-cutter screenplay. When \"Van Wilder 2\" opens, Taj has graduated from Coolidge College and has transferred to merry ole England. Our hero sets out to get his Master's Degree at a stodgy Cambridge-like university called Camford and follow in his father's footsteps as a lothario. Taj learns quickly that the natives are none too receptive to his desire to join their ranks in the elite Fox and Hounds' fraternity. Pipp Everett, the Earl of Grey (David Percival of the TV series \"Sinchronicity\"), the stuck-up man-in-charge of the Fox and Hounds, informs poor Taj that he has been rejected on a technicality. Searching for somewhere else to fit in, Taj takes the job of advising a minor fraternity made up entirely of misfits: Seamus (Glen Barry), a fiery Irish rugby player; Sadie (Holly Davidson) a tough female boozer; Simon (Anthony Cozen) a bean-pole genius, and Gethin (Steve Rathman) a well-endowed but shy guy. Taj names the new fraternity the Cock and Bulls. Actually, this is about as daring as \"Van Wilder 2\" gets.<br /><br />In a dastardly attempt to put upstart Taj and his new friends in their ignoble places, Pipp challenges our heroes to a high stakes university competition for the prestigious Camford Cup, an annual academic, social, and athletic contest between fraternities. Nothing inventive in the way of amusing sight gags or grandiose gross-out jokes emerges from this stale, substandard sequel. Director Mort Nathan, who helmed the laborious Cuba Gooding, Jr. comedy \"Boat Trip,\" makes the least of every comic opportunity in this prudish 95 minute potboiler. Indeed, Nathan and Gallagher revert to the general plot of the original without breaking new ground. When the snooty villains realize that they're going to lose the cup that the Fox and Hound fraternity has never forfeited, they plant incriminating evidence in the Cock and Bull's frat house. Consequently, dotty Camford Dean (veteran British TV actor Roger Hammond) has no choice but to expel Taj and his pals. Taj admits that he stole the test materials so that his pals can continue to compete in the tournament. Predictably, \"Van Wilder 2\" allows our oddball heroes to triumph over the Fox and Hounds without developing any suspense. Aside from Taj, the only character left over from the original \"Van Wilder\" was Van Wilder's pet bulldog.<br /><br />Mind you, National Lampoon usually scrapes the bottom of a barrel of monkeys for its college comedies, and \"Van Wilder 2\" proves no exception. Unlike the witty original, \"Van Wilder 2\" boasts no cameos from previous National Lampoon movie cast members. Kal Penn should have been working on a Harold and Kumar sequel rather than this infantile idiocy. \"Van Wilder 2\" ranks as a forgettable follow-up to the original with a modicum of witty lines.\n",

            "I have known of the story of the Indigo Children for quite some time now, and I have run across cases that seem genuine as well as cases that seem fraudulent. This movie is the latter. Riding the success of the far better \"What the Bleep do We Know?\" \"Indigo\" jumps on the new-age bandwagon by making a film, essentially, about super-children. This is not the purpose of the idea of Indigo Children.<br /><br />The Indigo Children are a new wave of children enjoying a maturity and a sensitivity unusual even in most adults. These children are great teachers, and they bring a childlike innocence back to the idea of wisdom. It is refreshing to see wisdom untainted by a jaded adult perspective in these children.<br /><br />\"Indigo,\" however, with its ludicrous plot and its poor acting, never substantiates any of its information. It merely tells us the story of a super-child who has control over everything. Ironically, the idea of control over anything is contrary to the very idea of wisdom. The filmmakers will tell you, before the film, that it was not dumbed down. I equate this with Nixon telling us he wasn't a crook. The film is completely dumbed down.<br /><br />I love the story of the Indigo Children, and I cannot do anything but hope that most of the cases are true, because, if they are, these children represent a new wave of society that is very promising. \"Indigo,\" however, represents one of the worst and most misrepresentative films I have ever seen. I was expecting a semi-documentary, looking at real cases of Indigo Children and the parents and guardians who have lived with them. Alas, this was not the case. I actually almost walked out, and I have never walked out or even considered walking out on a film before. I hope, for all of our sakes and for the reputation of Indigo Children, most people will give this one a pass.\n",

            "This movie has so many holes in the story I can't believe John Cassavetes wrote it and Nick Cassavetes directed this utter garbage. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, even John travolta's character was supposed to be the rock solid 'marriage & family' kind of guy, but with his disgusting foul language around the 3 daughters and the appalling disregard for any sense of discipline and wholesomeness for them was shocking. I know, this is real! This is the way it is out in the world! If this be so I truly see the dumbing down of America. These people didn't even have the common sense to come in out of the rain. Hustlers, thieves, not an ounce of compassion. Where do they get the money to produce these things?? I can understand the actors want to make a buck doing whatever. But I can't believe this movie made a return on anybody's investment.\n",

            "Personally, I found Tokyo 10+01 to be a funny, cartoony, lightweight, cute and trashy bit of fluffy nonsense. As cheaply made as it undoubtedly is (and looks it, much like most of his other movies such as Nagai Yume (Long Dream) which was still very much a triumph despite its costing limitations), Higuchinsky is fast proving himself to be the master of how to take a 100-yen budget and stretch it to its absolute limit whilst still maintaining a stylish aesthetic, in keeping with the character of the stories he is handling.<br /><br />The acting quality is utterly over-the-top, mischievous and silly - Masanobu Ando in particular appears to be having great fun messing with the role of Fake, a master fine-art forger whose portraits unfortunately look like they were painted by a monkey with two left hands. This is *clearly* not a movie made to be taken in the slightest bit seriously, referencing with a knowing wink many contemporary classics, including Ando's most Western-mainstream movie Battle Royale, and taking the mickey out of them quite mercilessly.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie greatly, but don't watch it thinking you're going to be getting anything as unique or profound as Uzumaki or Long Dream, otherwise you *will* be disappointed. Just enjoy it for what it is: a silly, lightweight spoof with no money behind it, but a great sense of humour.\n",

            "Stephen King's \"Children of the Corn\" story is relatively short so most of what is in the movies has nothing to do with his story. This is the last of the movies I saw, but many more sequels would for some reason follow. The first movie did have some elements that were found in the book, this one only a few concepts remain as it does a lot of things differently this time around. For one, you do not get the creepy abandoned looking town you found in the first movie, which is a shame as it is what made that film for me. You also do not have really much of anything as far as development goes as this film is for the most part very forgettable. The story centers around what are supposedly survivors from the town in the last movie and for some reason it seems the corn is infecting them in ways that once again make them into bad children, or bad teenagers for the most part. Yes, I would have to say all these movies would be more aptly titled teenagers of the corn rather than children, though I can guess they do it so they do not traumatize a really young kid.\n",

            "A young 28 year old Diana Ross earned an Oscar nomination for this 1972 movie about Billie Holiday. \"Lady Sings the Blues\" is a song written by jazz singer Billie Holiday, and jazz pianist Herbie Nichols. It is the title song to her 1956 album. In my opinion I thought Diana Ross did an OK job at portraying the troubled Billie Holiday. The many ups and downs of this famous singer are brought to life with Diana's performance. A co-star in the movie who I thought did a great job was 32 year old Richard Pryor. Pryor came through really well as someone who offered much support to Billie Holiday from very early on. Although there is some doubt of the accuracy of the book in which this movie is based, I still found it enjoyable enough to watch.\n",

            "In his biography of Clint Eastwood, Richard Schickel refers to a largely improvised scene between Clint and Tyne Daly, in a bar, where they compare notes and get drunk. Schickel calls it the best scene in the movie, and a first for any Eastwood film. They rolled camera and the actors just cut loose. At one point, Tyne even gets up to go to the restroom and, according to Schickel, it was so good it was left in the release print. Director James Fargo then shot some extra pickup footage, extra coverage, then edited the whole thing together. Again, he called it the best scene in the film; one that really cemented the close relationship between the two characters. So I'm watching the film last night. Both Clint and Tyne spar with each other, talking about getting a beer. Then we cut to a two shot, on a wharf pier, at a juice stand. Eastwood says \"All they had was apple juice.\" The actors start walking and drinking... the dolly movies... and they do a brief \"walk & talk.\" No bar, no improvisation, etc. And not much of a scene. Was this picture edited for video? Is this a replacement scene for TV? Very strange.\n",

It's like he came up with an amazing dilemma and just couldn't figure out an interesting way to solve it.<br /><br />A perfect plan right? A physco woman plotting revenge on the president is fortunate enough to slip pass the amazing security of the United State's Secret Service, with just a sniper from a building 50 feet away (amazing huh?), and infect him with an advanced form of the Ebola virus. But all her plans are ruined because of a little boy who is always sneaking around the hospital. And it's not as though this kid accidentally discovers her plan or anything like that, oh nohe just happens to be the only known survivor (other than the physco lady) of this strain of virus in the whole world. The world is so incredibly fortunate to have that kid in the hospital at just that right time. His white blood cells save the day great story? There were a lot of subplots within the story that were just weak. Dr. Landis's obsession with her work that inevitably ruins her social life could have been more developed. Her phone's ringing constantly in the beginning and for two days not a single call until the very end when she's walking away from the hospital. And at that time she decides that living a life is more important than work but where was that 'drive' during the rest of the movie? I don't know. It was a decent idea for a movie, just poorly written.\n",

            "This movie is composed of three short stories, all of them about homosexuality and in the small city of Homer. The first on passes in 1954, when a navy officer (the great actress Brittany Murphy) returns to Homer after quitting Navy. When the locals find out that indeed she was expelled from the Navy because of sexual deviation (i.e., lesbianism), she is discriminated and rejected by them. The second one takes place in 1974, and is about a teacher of French, gay not assumed aiming to be the principal of his school, and his best student, who is not secure of his sexual identity. The last one is in 2000 and is about a gay wedding between two successful men. When I watch a movie, I never read anything about it, because I want to have my own opinion. This film was a great surprise for me: its proposal is to show and discuss the prejudice of the society (who shares the common ground) against homosexuals and it is very well presented. The screenplay, performances and direction are superb, but I really would like to highlight the first short story: Brittany Murphy is really a great actress and has an outstanding performance.

            "I have to say this movie deserves a lot more credit than it gets. It may have been made around the same time as The Craft, but it accomplishes a lot to set itself apart. The basic story is the same, naughty schoolgirls discover witchcraft, but the execution sets them apart. The girls in Little Witches are much more like real girls, unlike the polished cliches we get in The Craft. And while it may not have the special effects budget of a hollywood blockbuster, it does a great job with what it does have, a strong story and compelling characters. Modern, more \"progressive\" witches may find the views of witchcraft this movie carries to be archaic, but hey, dancing naked in circles is a favorite pasttime of witches. So even if the movie doesn't thrill you, you can at least revel in the nude scenes (if you're into that sort of thing, that is). Hands down a great find in the rental store, and it definitely deserves a dvd release of it's own.\n",

            "Fans of Louise Brooks will want to see her in this, her talkie debut, but be forewarned: \"Windy Riley Goes Hollywood\" is a sorry excuse for a movie, a primitive comedy without any laughs featuring one of the most unappealing leading men imaginable. Our hero Windy Riley is a clueless, pompous, cigar-chomping jerk who messes up everything he touches and never realizes that everyone thinks he's a fool. He's played by a comedian named Jack Shutta whose performance won't leave you begging for more, but Shutta himself can't be blamed: who could have done any better with this feeble script, or with such a deeply exasperating character? The Windy Riley persona was originally created for a comic strip, and perhaps the strip was funny, I don't know, but based on the evidence at hand I have my doubts.<br /><br />Windy is on an unexplained cross-country trip from New York to his hometown of San Francisco, but he winds up in Hollywood instead, and is soon working at a movie studio --as a messenger boy. He attempts to get ahead by boosting the career of movie star Betty Grey (Miss Brooks), something he tries to accomplish by means of a dangerous and genuinely idiotic publicity stunt. Instead of boosting Betty's career he nearly ruins it, and is ultimately chased out of the studio --and Hollywood-- before he can do any real damage.<br /><br />Louise Brooks made this film after returning from Europe, where she'd appeared in the three movies that constitute her primary contribution to the cinema. She'd left Hollywood in 1929 on bad terms, having offended the Powers That Be at Paramount, and she came back with a reputation for being headstrong and uncooperative. On top of that, the talkie revolution was under way, plenty of old favorites were quickly falling by the wayside and all bets were off. None of the big studios wanted to deal with Brooks, so she wound up making her talkie debut here, in a low-budget two-reeler cranked out at Educational Pictures under the direction of another fallen star: Roscoe Arbuckle. The former top comedian had been banned from the screen almost ten years earlier but was making a decent living directing comedies for other performers under the name of William Goodrich. When he was inspired Arbuckle was a gifted director of comedy, but it's obvious from the opening scenes that the director found no inspiration in \"Windy Riley Goes Hollywood.\" Roscoe phoned this one in.<br /><br />So all we're left with is the sight of the leading lady, earnestly trying to play her part and deliver her clunky lines. It's a disheartening thing to experience. She gets to dance briefly, but of course her dance is quickly interrupted by the unstoppable Windy Riley. In her best silent films Louise Brooks was (and is) almost ethereal, but here the shoddy material makes her look and sound all too human. In her first scene as movie star Betty Grey, Brooks is presented with a publicity poster of herself and delivers her first line in a talkie: \"Oh Mr. Snell, I think it's great! A photograph like that oughta do me a lotta good, doncha think?\" That sound you hear is an ex-goddess, crashing to earth with a dull thud . . .\n",

            "The second of director Jeff Lieberman's trilogy of perfect B thrillers, the others being Squirm (1976) and Just Before Dawn (1981), is a clever shocker given some interesting spins. <br /><br />A young man stands accused of murder when one of his friends goes crazy during a party. He flees the police, discovers that other similar killings have taken place and that a brand of LSD is behind it. But what can he do to stop the power of 'Blue Sunshine'?<br /><br />Highly stylish, off-beat psychological thriller may just be the best testament to Lieberman's film making talents. Lieberman gives this film a haunting atmosphere, moments pure strangeness, and startling violence. Lieberman's story is a weird tale, tense with mystery and powered by an original concept. Charles Gross provides a beautiful and truly odd musical score that complements the mood of the film perfectly.<br /><br />The cast is quite good as well. Zalman King is the best as the film's rather unlikely hero.<br /><br />Blue Sunshine has become a bit of an underground classic, much like the other films of Lieberman, and it rightfully should be a classic. For those seeking an original horror-thriller with some weird twists, you won't find better than this!<br /><br />**** out of ****\n",

Au Pair was probably the worst film I have seen in my entire life. Your traditional cliched plot was something with which almost made me run away, and the fact that you know how everything will happen right from the word go is unbelievably annoying. The acting in this film represents that of the 'BAD telemovie' community very well. I normally have some understanding with telemovies, expecting them not to be brilliant but slightly entertaining, but this really is HORRIFIC for the telemovie image. The fact that this film is advertised as a family flick repulses me to the extent of running away to gasp for air, and wash my self because it is so dirty. Not dirty in your sexual or violent way but for the fact that a film could be this bad, and yet still make it on to TV screens. If this is what families of today are meant to sit down and watch together, then I am afraid we are looking at a very simple minded and uneducated future, with appauling senses of humour.<br /><br />If only there were a rating on IMDB lower than 1...

While Shaloub and Steven Colbert segments where worth a smile, overall, this movie is NOT funny.<br /><br />Secondly, I rented GNW having never heard of it. I also didn't know at the onset that it was about \"a post 9-11 New York.\" So while watching the film, none of that came through, even with the titles, and Jim Gaffigan's comment to \"When it all went down.\" I work in NYC, and probably have the same feelings and experiences as most average joe New Yorkers regarding 9-11. So even if I personally am sensitized to it, I didn't pick up on the theme until the very ending, and even then, it was incredibly under whelming.<br /><br />Thirdly, while I actually really liked aspects of GNW, like troubled child story, and Cake designer story, much of it was remarkably dull. It also didn't really come together. Not that there should have been a sing a long of all the characters, but the experiences in each of their lives didn't come together.<br /><br />Speaking of characters, at the video store, when I saw the cast, I thought, \"What an awesome cast! They couldn't possibly screw this up.\" And then they did. Edie Falco is in a single two minute scene. Stephen Colbert has only one real scene, and a pop-in in another. Olympia Dukasis' story is awful. Simply boring. With no point. Her acting is great, but the material she's working with is trite.<br /><br />I love a good subtext...I love subtle elements of a movie...I love roundabout and interesting ways of doing things. But Great New Wonderful does not achieve that. I was so let down by this film, that I watched the directors commentary to see if he could explain it away (like explaining a joke). Turns out the script was based on a couple of plays that HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH 9-11.<br /><br />And that's the jist, folks. Great New Wonderful was a movie where someone said, \"Let's do a film about the daily grind of life after Nine Eleven,\" and everyone around them said, \"What a great idea...that sound really important.\" A lot of local NY celebrities clearly loved the idea.<br /><br />But in the end, Great New Wonderful just didn't work.\n",

The characters are perfectly realistic, and so are their situations. There's no scenes where characters fall in love in 2 minutes and break up in 2 minutes. The dialogue is very interesting, but it's not flashy. They talk the way real people talk. The movie is a voyeuristic glimpse into the lives of these real New Yorkers (they're really actors, but they seem completely real). The humor is funny, but not forced. There's even a good deal of sex jokes, but they're all done in good taste. The acting is terrific. Rosario Dawson is beautiful. David Krumholtz is the most entertaining of the bunch. Dennis Farina provides great comic relief. Stanley Tucci delivers one of his best performances. And being that I'm an aspiring independent filmmaker, this movie really inspires me. I watch a lot of mainstream films, watch a certain scene or shot and say, \"That's really cool!\" Yet I think to myself, that's impossible to do on a low-budget. This movie was made on a very low budget and it's absolutely terrific! It's not one of these pretentious, \"Blair Witch\"-type projects where we're watching a big old mess, but we're supposed to give it acclaim because it costed below a million bucks. The only thing I have to criticize is the overuse of the jump-cuts. I have nothing against the jump-cut, but the jump-cuts in this film get a bit jarring at times.

I even felt sorry for him seeing how much he suffers acting in this movie. I doubt he faked his drinking... He is talented actor, but not even his talent couldn't make him even to try to act. I don't blame him. Sergej Trifunović is giving his best. Which means that he suck. Yup, Emir at least has talent, this poor sob doesn't... Only possible explanation why would anyone even consider him for (any) role is fact that he look like what other ex-YU nations see as a stereotypical Serb. Funny enough, Serbs see him as stereotypical Albanian... Toni Gojanović... is chosen for this role simply because he's Croat... Croatia have much better actors than him (is he an actor at all?), but he does seems to be trying, and since he's a \"newb\", we can look trough his fingers...<br /><br />Now, take a better look... Bosniak, Serb and Croat... and voilà, you have a generic ex-YU wannabe comedy... and that's it. It tries to look at war and reasons for war trough comedy but it just fail... there is no deep background story, there is no secret agendas, there is no comedy there is no nothing.. Movie was heavily advertised here as \"Movie that put together Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks in hilarious comedy\" and people wanted to see trough Karaula their youths and lives in pre-1991. Yugoslavia, but most of them abandoned theater before end because they have found foreign country and foreign army with foreign people and foreign stories. Something they didn't wanted or cared to see. Macedonia is foreign to Serbs, YPA is foreign to Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats are foreign to Serbs. Famous scene at the end of movie where actors get out on stage and public isn't tapping is clear sign what public thinks about this movie. <br /><br />I thought that pathetic ex-YU ethnic humor has died in 1991. And it did. This is just zombiefied version if it, and it's not funny. It's sad. Strange thing I find is the fact that only in Serbia this movie was advertised like this is 1975, like we all live in perfect \"brotherhood and unity\" and that war never happened. Film had financial success in all countries of former YU, except in Serbia, despite big advertising campaign. Movie entered trough big doors, but it exited through back door, quietly and shamefully. This movie is wanting to look back at last moments of Yugoslavia, it is trying to say to us that it's not our fault, that we all were seduced by \"drunken and selfish\" leaders, blah, blah, blah... It could make some point if it was released during 1995; 1996; or 1997; considering that war and Yugoslavia were still \"fresh\" and all... but in 2006, this movie just doesn't make sense... <br /><br />Legacy of this movie is big. Yup, before this movie, many various EX-YU actors and directors were talking about making some new movies as homage to old partisan films... luckily, this movie showed that it would be just waste of money...<br /><br />I want my 94 minutes back.\n",

Very few made it such as Jane Powell, Debbie Reynolds both born of April Fools Day, Natalie Wood, just to mention a few. Cliff Robertson was a known actor but never really made it to star-status. Keith Andes was a fine singer and had played the lead role in Kiss Me Kate on Broadway, but never really made it in Hollywood as an actor or the excellent singer that he was. Kaye Ballard was known for her cukoo comedy talents and had appeared as one of the Wicked-Step Sisters in the original Juile Andrews version of Rogers and Hammerstein's Cinderella on T.V., and played in the Mothers-In-Law on T.V. with the other Mother in Law Eve Arden. Una Merkel made herself into a star by playing secondary roles such as Kitty Kelly in The Merry Widow with Land Tuner and the housekeeper in Rich, Young, and Rretty, again, with Jane Powell. Kelly Brown appeared in the movie Oklahoma and Seven Brides for Seven Browthers as one of town-folks line-dancer, but if you were a dancer you knew who he was, and Tommy Noonan made himself into a star by playing secondary roles such as Marily Monores dim-witted husband to be in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, but his best role was as the gum-chewing Pianist in A Star is Born with Judy Garland. In fact, Noonan showed that he was a fine actor by stealing the last scene from Judy Garland in A Star Is Born when he tells her how pitiful she's behaving since Norman Maine had committed suicide, but there is one person in the line-dancers that's had a history that no one knows about.<br /><br />Here's in Cincinnati, Ohio, we have had our share of famous actors and actress' such as Doris Day, Tyrone Power, George Chikarus, Vera Ellen, and a very famous criminal with the initials of C.M. that we don't like to talk about. Harvey Evens is from our area. He had been studying dancing with Harris Rosedale, I know this to be a fact because I was there too, but his name was Harvey Honnacker. I guess he changed his last name to Evans because he couldn't get his last name up in lights. Too long. So, I remember one day he came into the studio and said, \"I have nothing here\" and went to study with Leo and Rita McNeil. Later he went to New York. Then he went to Hollywood where he did chorus work in The Pajama Game, West Side Story under his original name, and The Girl Most Likely. Later he did the T.V. version of Applause playing the gay hair-dresser and friend of Margo Channing played by Lauren Bacall. Since I knew LeRoy Reams who played the role originally, I asked LeRoy if he had recommended Harvey to play his role, and he said no; that he got it on his own. I'm not sure, but I heard through certain channels that Harvey passed away. What a talent he was. I remember seeing him in a dance recital given by the O'Neils when he was there and he sang a jazzed up version of Indian Love Call and did a dance ending up with his jumping up on the side on stage and back down like James Cagney did in Yankee Doodle Dandy. What a talent he was. It's just a shame he, like many others, were never allowed to show the full power of their talent in the entertainment field!\n",

            "This was the first movie that I had watched from this genre, so I'm not knowledgeable enough to give a full, professional review as I am not a movie critic, producer, or director. I am a just a movie goer interested in enjoyable, quality films. Although the genre appears to be an interesting one, I was not impressed with the movie itself. There may be other more enjoyable movies out there in the same genre. Or for that matter, this movie could be one of the best in this genre, which may be an indication why these types of movies are not mentioned or talk about in the mainstream media.<br /><br />I can express with great certainty that the editing could have been better as often there are instances when the screen goes dark for several seconds in between scenes, leaving the audience wondering what's next. However, it isn't a bad idea to experience something different, and this movie is definitely different from what we hear or see in the mainstream media.\n",

The actor Mark Harmon ( Agent Gibbs ) is ex marine Who haves a great instinct The actors Micheal Weatherly ( Agent DiNozzo ), Sasha Alexander ( Agent Todd ) and Sean Murray ( Agent McGee ) Are funny Todd and DiNozzo always blackmails each other or DiNozzo looks always in to the privacy of Todd and DiNozzo always fools around with McGee.

            "I watched this show when I was 19. I enjoyed it since it seemed to grasp how every marriage that I knew from friends and family. Granted not all marriages are carbon copies of the ones on the show, but at least it hits on ones that are familiar. I found that the awkward moments with Mickey (Mike Binder) and his wife (Sonya Walger) looked like bad acting seemed to emphasize that awkward feelings they were having. Little nuances like this made it a little better for me. And the support characters are real to me. Especially since I have been on both sides (being the single guy and the married guy *sort of) The complaints seem real and the responses genuine as far as I could tell. I have since watched it and still find the humor. I was more curious about how long the show would last since they covered the main question of infidelity? The second season I am sure covered another topic, but I don't really remember. I do hope they put out the second season just so I can complete my thoughts on the show. All in all I did enjoy it when I was single and when I got into a serious relationship.\n",

            "I've seen quite a few Chaplin shorts from early in his career and I've noticed that his early stuff (done for Keystone Studios) is pretty dreadful stuff. Unlike his wonderful full-length films from the 20s and 30s, the films from 1914-1915 are incredibly poorly made--having no script but only vague instructions from the director. In most cases, the films had almost no plot and degenerated to people punching and kicking each other.<br /><br />This film consists of a lot of barroom scenes as well as scenes where Charlie is an artist. Apparently, he'd been an artist but it all went to pieces when his love left him for another. Oddly, the captions say \"two months later\" between scenes. After only two months, he sees her and her new beau and they've got a bunch of kids--some looking at least 6 or 8. This and the paint on him that appeared and then disappeared due to bad editing make this an odd and confusing picture. Unfortunately, none of the stuff is particularly interesting.\n",

I could swear at one point i heard my television crying in sorrow. the long and short of it is i wanted to stab my eyes out with a rusty knife. Yeah, not a very good movie.\n",

            "Odd to term a 1995 film as an 'older movie', but SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT was rather dismissed in its initial release as a bit of fluff: looking at the film now reveals a tight little message movie garnished with a fine writer (Callie Khouri - 'Thelma and Louise', 'Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'), and first class director (Lasse Hallström - 'Casanova', 'An Unfinished Life', 'The Shipping News', 'Chocolat', 'The Cider House Rules', 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' etc), and a cast that has not only grown in importance from the time of this film but has also become acknowledged as the creme of the cinema.<br /><br />The story is rather slight: Grace (Julia Roberts) is a Southern Belle horse trainer married to handsome but womanizing Eddie (Dennis Quaid) who discovers to her amazement that Eddie is dating other women. This throws Grace into a rage that affects her family, her family's typical Southern response to appearances, and ultimately awakens not only Grace but also every member of her family to secrets that allow them to take charge of their prettified hollow lives! Grace's sister Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick, in yet another of her sensational roles) is a perky, spitfire of a woman who seems to be the only member who has her act together; her mother Georgia (Gena Rowlands) and father Wyly (Robert Duvall) are both able to reveal the old South and the new individuality they achieve; Brett Cullen, Haley Aull, and Muse Watson are all excellent in their roles.<br /><br />One of the most entertaining aspects of this entertaining film is the confrontation between 'old manners' and new reality - with some heady lessons for all of us to observe and allow chuckles. It is a tight little film that deserves another visit on DVD.\n",

            "Chronicles of Riddick, which I just got back from seeing was perhaps one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and this is coming from someone who loves Science Fiction a great deal. This movie was horrible, it made no sense, and then when things started to make a little sense it didn't make the plot any better. Vin Disel can act... as himself, which means the way he always acts-- as the near silent tough guy. I found him much more believable in the Fast and the Furious, and much more laughable in this movie.<br /><br />There were more cheesy lines in this movie than an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie and Matrix: Revolutions put together. It made me realize why, exactly, we accompany other people to the movies for... to groan together when a movie becomes too unbearable to stand. The characters, all of them, were wooden and cardboard and talked in stilted monosyllable sentences. It was like watching a cruel parody of a great epic like \"Lord of the Rings\" gone horribly wrong. <br /><br />The special effects and camera work of the movie does little to save it, but it was at least something to focus on when I couldn't stand the acting (or lack of acting) anymore. There were some really disorientating fight scenes where the use of strobe lights was way overdone and headache inducing.<br /><br />Any feminist who watches this movie will be blown away by the absurd amount of machismo in this... men posture and posture more, while the women cower in fear and wait to be saved. A minor exception is a bounty hunter girl who is featured along with the rest of her nameless crew. Dame Vaako is put in her place early by a man saying exactly that, but proves herself to be, well, a little more than a sex object as she starts to convince Vaako to overthrow the throne with her. Yay, stereotypical evil woman in tightfitting clothing. That look like they hurt for that matter. Kyra made even less sense, as in the beautiful long haired acrobatic girl who can apparently take care of herself, then still needs Riddick to come save her at least three times in the movie. Was there anything in this movie that wasn't stereotypical? *yawns* <br /><br />The ending, which was an ending I actually quite enjoyed, I was already so jaded by the rest of the movie to care much. <br /><br />In conclusion this is a horribly written, horribly constructed, disjointed light show with stilted dialogue and wooden performances. If you must watch this movie watch it for the few times that the cinematography breaks out of headache inducing mode and actually shines, as well as some of the special effects, because you aren't going to get much else out of Chronicles of Riddick.\n",

            "XXX is back, only this time, he's not a bald white extreme sports star turned secret agent. He's now a black ex-convict with only slightly more hair in the form of Ice Cube. But that doesn't stop NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons (Samuel Jackson) from recruiting him to stop the country's Secretary of Defense (Willem Dafoe) from plotting a coup against the United States government.<br /><br />The premise is a non issue here and there's actually very little resembling a plot. Sure, there some whispers about protecting the president but there's nothing too complex here. The script was written by Simon Kinberg and he usually focuses on the action sequences and not the story. For example, he also wrote the screenplay for Mr. and Mrs. Smith and that film was heavy on action, low on story. The action sequences are pretty nice and entertaining to watch. The action is the real reason to watch the movie since everything else is handled poorly. Judging from the user comments, a lot of people took the film too seriously when really this sequel is a harmless movie. Obviously the story and action scenes are highly unrealistic but so what? This movie is clearly stupid and mindless yet still mildly entertaining.<br /><br />The acting is alright, at least the important characters can act. Ice Cube actually gives a pretty good performance as XXX. He does a better job than Vin Diesel and he shows a lot of charisma in the role as well. Samuel L. Jackson returns as Gibbons and he also gives a good performance. Willem Dafoe gives a decent performance though he isn't given very much screen time. The rest of the supporting actors aren't as good. Xzibit, Nona Gaye and Sunny Mabrey all give awful performances which isn't too surprising but they don't hurt the film.<br /><br />I actually like Lee Tamahori as a director. He makes his films simple yet still entertaining. Lee did a good job with this film and the action scenes look terrific. However, this is probably his weakest film yet. Despite the action scenes, the film does get a little dull. I wasn't surprised by this and there was really nothing they could have done since the film was 95 minutes long. Before I saw this sequel, I was expecting the worst. To my surprise, the movie turned out to be okay. Sure the dialog is pretty lame and character development is non existent but the movie proved to be harmless and enjoyable. In the end, this sequel is worth a rental as long as your brain is turned off. Rating 5/10\n",

I have to say I think this movie is seriously overrated.<br /><br />I understand why people would prefer this over TBC. The script is not bad, the camera work is not bad, the editing is not bad. A lot of the dialog is smart. Unfortunately, when the dialog isn't smart, it's downright smarmy, completely off the mark. But what makes this a truly inferior movie is the ACTING! <br /><br />Jon Lovitz's \"It's ACTING!\" came to mind no more than ten minutes into this movie. I couldn't get past the atrocious delivery, intonation, pacing, and fake emotion of just about every actor in this movie. Just really, really bad. There's no way to soft pedal. Even the (now) reliable David Strathairn will make you wince. I couldn't help thinking that this is one movie Sayles could remake and greatly improve upon just by using good, professional actors.<br /><br />So, if you're like me, someone who actually thinks TBC is a good movie, and you've heard The Return of the Secaucus 7 praised as infinitely superior . . . lower your expectations.

Considering how many kills there are in this trash fest, you'll become so familiar with the gator's incisors, you might start giving each tooth a name.<br /><br />Ridiculous and deranged. So much so, it begins to look like it's a parody, but I think the film actually took itself seriously. This is one of those flicks with so many outrageously stupid lines it could become a cult classic of the so-bad-it's-good kind. The acting is beyond atrocious. There's one Jessica Simpson look alike who is casually jogging around (looking like she's doing an episode of Bay Watch) through the forest after seeing two gruesome deaths. The skeptics she encounters recite lines like robots. There's three dimwitted twerps who flunked out of Animal House wandering around looking for an anti-drunkenness elixir. Then there's some whack lady (an unrecognizable Kelly McGillis) who wants to catch the thing. And some poor man's Capt. Ahab who also wants to croak it.

Terrified extras screaming and running: straight out of an old Godzilla type flick.

            "Coeurs, the latest achievement of French master Alain Resnais, stands out as one of the finest European productions of 2006, a fact confirmed by the Silver Lion it was awarded in Venice. While the critics and audience at the festival were more anxious to see other films, like The Black Dahlia or INLAND EMPIRE, this small, intimate, bittersweet character study quietly moved towards well deserved recognition, proving that the great New Wave director had lost none of his special touch.<br /><br />Like one of his best known films, Smoking/No Smoking, Coeurs is based on a play by Alan Ayckbourn. But whereas Smoking/No Smoking retained its untarnished Englishness, Resnais makes it pretty clear that he's keeping his new work as distant as possible from its literary source: the title is completely different (as the French filmmaker thought Private Fears in Public Places was misleading in regards to the subject), and the story is set in Paris, with the inevitable (and, I might add, quite brilliant) changes in the dialogue that this requires.<br /><br />The film focuses on six people struggling to achieve or maintain meaningful relationships. There's the aging Thierry (André Dussollier, funny and heartbreaking at the same time) who has to fight his feelings for his younger assistant (Sabine Azéma). There's his sister Gaelle (Isabelle Carré), who goes out on blind dates every night and always comes back hugely disappointed. There's Nicole (Laura Morante), a frustrated woman who's trying to find a nice apartment whilst dealing with her unemployed and increasingly detached boyfriend, Dan (Lambert Wilson). And there's Lionel (Pierre Arditi, a laconic revelation), a lonely bartender who has to take care of his father, the rude, sex-obsessed Arthur (Claude Rich, heard but not seen). Over the course of four days, these characters will meet and affect each others'lives in unexpected, amusing, but also very touching ways.<br /><br />With this masterwork, Resnais proves himself a true auteur, telling us an apparently simple tale of love and longing with a direct, honest approach, from the hilarious beginning to the moving, open conclusion. In adapting Ayckbourn's stage work, he manages the impossible, which is to make the movie look theatrical but not overly bizarre, using subtle, unpretentious tricks: the speaking parts belong solely to the six leading actors (plus Rich's priceless vocal cameo), every single scene takes place indoors (and the locations are always the same), and, most importantly, sequences are linked by a metaphorical snowfall, which gives the film a poetic, almost magical feel.<br /><br />Those who thought Closer could have benefited from less swearing and more sympathy for its characters should watch Coeurs. It may not exactly end on a happy note, but at least it doesn't risk sliding into misanthropy. Beneath the apparent pessimism, there's a heart beating. The heart of an experienced director who hasn't stopped to amaze us.\n",

I have an old tape that I made from TV, it isn't very good quality and each time I watch it I worry that it is going to disintegrate.

            "This beautiful film is another action western about Union and Confederate soldiers at a western outpost whose task is to hold the territory for the Union, prevent rebel defections, and fight Indians. A pretty rebel sympathizer uses her charms to effect an escape of Confederate officers and the hunt is on. William Holden and Eleanor Parker play off one another well in this tug of war and wills with John Forsythe hovering as an interested party. The film has exciting cavalry-Indian battle scenes, and the second clash is particularly novel in its execution because it is done by Indians. A craven rebel soldier proves to be the unlikely hero at the wind up. The picture was filmed largely in Death Valley and is striking in its great visual beauty.\n",

            "I first saw this send-up of \"the prodigal son\" when I was a high school freshman. I think my teacher and I were the only 2 people laughing. I was astonished that a film that looks like it was filmed in a garage could make my face hurt. It has wonderfully screwy story arc, corny gags; it's all over the place and ends abruptly, but I love it. <br /><br />The Vaudeville origins of some corny bits (the snow gag) amuse. Other motifs of the period are not worthy of inclusion, but what little writing there is makes me laugh as hard as anything recent. Fields' hogwash ditty is pretty terrific. I especially love a few of the sight gags, including a runt of a dog on a sled team, a leggy salvation army gal, and W.C. calling for Lena the elk. The sound quality is heinous, but the arbitrary scene changes relieve some of the tedium and claustrophobia of other Fields shorts (The Golf Specialist).<br /><br />It mocks everything in sight; staginess, melodrama, propriety, actors who mispronounce words. I don't know that there any other 18 minutes of film make me smile as much as this ridiculous little movie.\n",

I have a number of friends and family members who would get a kick out of the irony, the dry humor, the only-slightly-overplayed stereotyped characters.

A good half (if not more) of Russian films deal with what Russians term the Great Patriotic War, and yet precious few of them are so profound and universally understood as Grigory Chukhrai's classic.<br /><br />It's a simple story about a young soldier, Alyosha (Vladimir Ivashov), who has just 48 hours of furlough. Since Russia is so vast, he uses practically all that time to travel home to his mother. Along the way, he finds romance and lives a lifetime in limited time.<br /><br />The film is exquisitely crafted, well-paced and deeply moving in its evocation of the bonds of love and family.

            "Renoir was still a master and had definitely not lost his touch when he made this saga about a year in the life of a desperately poor farming family trying to make it. The only thing that mars it, keeping it from rating a 10, are the cutesy-poo children and the saccharine music on the soundtrack, making it perfectly clear exactly how you were supposed to feel at any given moment. I suppose these were necessary nods to Hollywood conventions of the time. Kudos must go to Zachary Scott for the courage of his performance in the lead. An underrated actor, Scott was nearly always cast playing lounge lizards and other assorted slimeballs. Here he appears without his mustache and is almost unrecognizable. Given that Scott aspired to a career as a Gable-type leading man, this role was not a good career move. But it is definitely the performance of his career, and along with the equally outstanding performance of Betty Field, makes the film. Incidentally, I could have done without the over the top performance of Beulah Bondi as Granny; throughout the film I kept hoping Scott would strangle her.\n",

            "I found this movie somewhat by mistake and am glad that I did. While it may not be the best movie ever made, but may will be one of the most important films of the decade. The film is one of the first full features made in Cambodia since the 1970's when the Khmer Rougue Regime took over. In 1975 films and other cultural activities were ordered to cease, and subsequently many actors, writers, and directors were executed. Eventually the Khmer Rougue fell, and Cambodia started to rebuild there film industry. What make this movie even more remarkable is the fact that it was made without any many of the essentials one needs to make a film, or even movie theatres in which to show it. Not to mention the complete lack of acess to such things as \"digital effects\" that Hollywood is all to reliant on these days. Yet some how they were ale to pull it off. The movie features some beautifully shot scenery, and may be worth the price of admission for the Ankor Wat(sp?) scene alone. Although there are some problems with the visual aspects of the movie, remember the resources the filmakers were dealing with, the color is very good. Pich Chanboramey does an excellant job as Soraya (the lead), as well as the other actors in the film. This film is a must see, and is hopefully a indication of a new renaissance of Cambodian film making. In case you were wondering why that Snake hair looks so real? Well.........it's really live snakes glued and tied to a headset\n",

She -once more- proved that she really is the Queen of Pop, a tremendous trend-setter as far as fashion, politics and religion are concern. Her show was clearly provocative but was extremely inspired and glamorous. Madonna stands alone between two worlds... The stage and her family. There are numerous juxtapositions inside the film...Madonna is spectacular on the stage, but she is also a woman with political and ethical values. I have to admit that perhaps she gave too much emphasis to her being a follower of Caballah, but on the hole the film is great...A must for all Madonna fans and for people who love show business. A graphic and artistic triumph by any means. Generally speaking, I saw a Madonna much more wise, raw,authentic and determined. She has a belief and she stands for it.<br /><br />Oh, and if you need some extra pop-star glam quality seek for the name Anna Vissi. She is huge...\n",

I guess the women were pretty enough and they were quite shapely. As for the men they all hailed from muscle beach. This was a beefcake fest with the beastly men differentiated from the handsome men primarily by the fact they were hairy. The handsome guys were shaved clean and oiled to boot.

The reviewer either never actually saw the entire film or had an agenda to sink it. When I first saw it my girlfriend (who isn't Jewish) and I and the vast majority of the audience, were roaring with laughter. We returned a number of times with friends and family and everyone loved it.<br /><br />13 years later I had the privilege of having Sid Ceasar in my car (I was hired to take him to his hotel) and I asked him about the film. He said that he had a lot of fun making the movie, but the studio provided very limited money to advertise and promote the product. No press, no promotion. Studio politics.<br /><br />Gardenia (overbearing father) and Medford (sweet, but loopy wife and mother) are the parents of Arkin, the older son who lives outside the family home and Reiner (intimidated, milquetoast) who lives in. The family owns a failing, indebted department store. Arkin is married to Anjanette Comer, who desperately wants a child. Arkin claims he is impotent because of the tyranny of his father and the fact that he is the hated high school basketball coach whose team can't even win one game. Ceasar plays a wacky WWII patient at the the VA hospital who still believes that the war is still ongoing.<br /><br />On a road trip to Florida, Gardenia secretly sets into motion a scheme to burn his Dept. store down and collect the Fire Insurance. Arkin and Reiner think that his parents' absence presents the perfect opportunity to prove their father wrong and refurbish and restock the store and make a success of it. They don't know of the plot and go to work. Ceasar as Gardenia's unwitting foil is priceless. The pace of the film accelerates and is replete with a few clever twists. This effort is worth a sincere second look and a re-release.\n",

She has had mental issues since the death of her parents ten years ago. Since then she has been raised by her Grandfather and step-Grandmother. With his cunning wit and charm mixed with her perceived lack of mental stability and a very hard, stern step-Grandmother he seems to have her in the palm of his hands.<br /><br />If that sounds like a TV movie it is probably because it should be only I think even the Lifetime movies of the week are above this.<br /><br />The acting isn't stale, it is decomposing, very slowly before our very eyes. The supposed twist are predictable and expected.<br /><br />One of the main flaws is the lack of any reason we have to believe our lady heroine has any serious mental issues. There is nothing to even remotely suggest this. I guess we are to just go by faith that she had some real breakdowns back in the day even though it is never seen or mentioned.<br /><br />There are only two good things about this movie. The director does give us some different camera angles but it doesn't make up for everything else in this movie. Also, it is nice that the cops aren't made out to be complete fools like in most movies.<br /><br />There are some other things in this movie that have glaring holes but I dare not point them out here in case you are actually wanting to watch this movie.<br /><br />So, if you're at Hollywood Video and see this one in front of you in the horror section, just repeat this to yourself \"Put it down, take a step back, turn to the left and then calmly but promptly walk away.\" 1 out of 10.\n",

I was completely and totally awestruck by the quality of the acting. Thirty minutes into this film, I felt the strongest identity with each of the characters and my heart actually ached for them. There is so much truth and honesty, so much clarity, that I feel gifted just to have seen this movie and I will remember it the rest of my life. Absolutely fantastic!!! If this is the only drama you will ever see, do yourself a favor and let it be All Or Nothing.\n",

            "i don't know how somebody got this film funded. this is by far one of the worst films ever made, and i like the other 9. if you do watch this, get the unrated version; it is significantly better for gore fans. i do still watch it for the blood and laughs. the premise is that only a vorhees can kill jason and she has to use a specific knife. so, jason has a living relative somehow...but that's not the complicated part of the story. jason is ambushed by the s.w.a.t. team (i'll never understand why a s.w.a.t. team member would pause for a shower when trying to draw a serial killer into a trap) and blown to bits. then, naturally, a mortician eats jason's heart (out)! now, the mortician has the power and mind of jason, but it wears on him, like in stephen king's \"desperation\" and \"the regulators\" (as richard bachman), so he has to pass on the heart when the body starts to wear, and then somebody else is jason. then the ending. i hate to give it away, so stop reading if it will bother you to find out this travesty of an ending. he gets stabbed, but isn't dying, so massive hands from hell burst through the ground and start to drag him into hell! you think it's over, but no! then the wind starts to blow the dust, and you see that his mask is still there...and freddy kruger's claw bursts through the ground and pulls away the mask while laughing. what an appropriate ending to that one. the good news is, i use this for an example in my class as a deaux ex machima each semester.\n",

            "This show was a family favorite when I was growing up. As much as a TV show can, it influenced my perception of the grown-up world in general and of New Yorkers in particular.<br /><br />Seen today, it is like an American time capsule. Its nonstop parade of personalities of all types amounts to a wonderful snapshot of what America was like at the time. It is still greatly entertaining, but has acquired the additional virtue of being a sort of history lesson. What's My Line and To Tell the Truth provide some of that that too, but they don't compare to this crazy freeform show where anything could happen.<br /><br />Its format, or lack of it, was a perfect match for Steve Allen, and the later shows where he was the host are every bit as much fun as the Garry Moore shows, in my opinion.<br /><br />If you have any interest at all in what entertainment was like for previous generations, you should include this show in your travels.\n",

            "Tex Avery's 'I Love to Singa' is a cartoon which confounds expectations about both Avery's work and Warner Bros. cartoons in general. At this early stage in their development, the Merrie Melodies series of cartoons were an attempt to rival the prestige colour cartoons of Walt Disney, often by emulating them. Thus 'I Love to Singa' is full of cute, wide-eyed characters and a sweet, slow-moving plot. However, it's what Avery does with these character that makes 'I Love to Singa' a mini-masterpiece. A parody of 'The Jazz Singer', 'I Love to Singa' stars a baby owl named Owl Jolson, a jazz lover born into a family of classical musicians. When an over-zealous Papa Owl throws his son out for insisting on singing jazz, Owl Jolson goes on to win a radio talent contest and, subsequently, the approval of his family. This thinnest of plots is infused with enormous appeal through Avery's mixture of strikingly handsome, warm visuals and hilarious character comedy. The cartoon is nearly stolen by a stammering hillbilly bird and his laboured rendition of Simple Simon but ultimately 'I Love to Singa' belongs to Owl Jolson, a character who manages to be cute without being cloying. Every time he opens his mouth to sing, 'I Love to Singa' positively lights up. While you won't find any of the anarchic humour associated with Warner Bros. or the 100mph pacing and exaggerated reaction shots associated with Avery here, what you will find is an exceptional example of great storytelling and charming character comedy. 'I Love to Singa', while too sweet for some viewers, is a true classic in my eyes and I adore it more ever time I see it.\n",

            "In the wake of destruction, the world falls into silence, and memories of those lost flicker across flames, whispers in bleeding hearts, and love taken rises up to heaven to tell of how they lived and how they will never be forgotten. But how do you live after something like this? How does the heart heal, and how do you let go? How do you live, and would you ever be able to love again? <br /><br />Love is the perfect memory that clings to your heart when the world is brought to its knees, and life refuses to surrender. Jagged pieces of what would never be again cuts deep, but time fights to pull it back together. And the world finds a way to rise up once more, and the heart rebuilds. But love might be denied, and love lost may be found. And the strength of one woman in her darkest hour lights up through the tremendous talent of Michelle Williams, and the fires of drama burn bright.

Is invited to be best man at his brother Pauls(Breckin Meyer) wedding. During that time he meets up with an old child hood friend and former lover Jenna(Jennifer Garner), and pretty much begins hitting on most of the brides maid. But is quickly visited by the ghost of his rich uncle(Michael Douglas), and tells him that he will be visited by three ghosts, in hopes that they will make him see the error of his ways.<br /><br />Although the idea was good, but it went nowhere, cause it had very little laughs. Matthew McConaughey doesn't show much here in this role, he is so unlikable and makes it impossible to care about him. Jennifer Garner really surprised me here, she gave a real strong performance, and her performance was not week like it was in Catch and Release(2006). And she and McConaughey have very little chemistry. Now Emma Stone is pretty much a scene stealer as the ghost of girlfriends past, she got some laughs. But Michael Douglas's character began to wear out his presence.<br /><br />A little note: Christa B. Allen who plays teenage Jenna, also starred in 13 going on 30(2004), in which she also played a teenage version of Jennifer Garner character.\n",

            "\"The Insider\" in many ways reflects the golden days of American cinematography, where every scene serves a purpose, dialogue is sharp and poignant, and characters and events remain true to their emotions and nature.<br /><br />The film presents certain questions throughout its duration that are intended to invoke thought in the viewer, and at the same time explores them to unprecedented depths which are by no means native to the film industry. The story is of a quick-paced nature, and demands that the viewer pay the utmost attention to every single line and image presented; it flabbergasts in its unparallelled structure of continuity and coherence to those sentient enough.<br /><br />After watching this film, it became apparent why Crowe was so reluctant to play the role of Maximus in \"Gladiator\" after acting the part of Jeffrey Wigand. It appears more or less as if Crowe had been this character in reality, and it really inspires to see that such a talented actor is finally beginning to enjoy the prominence that he deserves.<br /><br />In the past decades, there has been a progressive decline in the number of intelligent films making it onto the market, but the success of \"The Insider\" will hopefully serve as a shout-out to all the film companies and directors reluctant to tread on such sensitive ground. This movie could not receive a higher recommendation!\n",

            "How marvelous to see an entertaining and thoughtful horror film come from Australia! As a regular moviegoer, and an Australian, I love watching all sorts of Australian films. I was lucky enough to see a special screening of lost things last year, which included a discussion with the director and various crew members. I must admit that, at first, I found lost things to be quite ridiculous. Some dialog seemed strange and there were some wobbly acting moments. But quite soon after-wards, I was really drawn in by the stunning landscape, and as the plot began to thicken, I was truly captivated. \"Lost Things\" was an enchanting experience, and most importantly, it was a horror film which managed to, in some respect, defy the genre, by placing itself in the beautiful Australian beach landscape by day. Also amazing was the twist. A horror film that made me think! Definitely not your usual \"slasher flick,\" Lost things wasn't a \"Look Both Ways\" or \"Little Fish,\" but was most definitely a considerable achievement.\n",

Maybe when this movie was released it had some significance, but it is not worth the rental unless you want to see how bad film-making can be.<br /><br />If anything this movie is about how a guy with a camera can get a woman's attention, and sleep with them. They are first pulled in under the guise that he is making a documentary about \"Sherman\". Then once they are on camera, they do stupid things and tell their life stories which are not even interesting. All the while the author, who himself has the personality of a stone and wallows in his own self pity, tries to sleep with them.<br /><br />He also seems to go out of his way to reinforce the typical \"Southern\" stereotypes. I will not go into unnecessary detail here.<br /><br />Overall the movie has a quality that two kids with a VHS camcorder could duplicate, and zero plot. This is nothing more than a movie about a self obsessed person driving around looking for woman to try to sleep with.<br /><br />It is pretty clear to me after watching the movie that Ross had never intended on making a movie about Sherman, but rather was the inventor of the modern day self absorbed BLOG.<br /><br />TERRIBLE - POINTLESS - BAD FILM\n",

            "This is one of those movies that really should have been better. First, take it for what it is worth - a jiggle film. Given that, the scenes are pretty risque: bottomless front shots of women and all that (that is, if you see the unrated version, I guess). The two female leads, Landon Hall and Ahmo Height, are both well suited to this type of movie. Height, a glamour model in her second movie, is particularly energetic in her roles. She reminds me of Lisa Boyle (Cassandra Leigh) from several years ago. Hall is clearly less concerned about emoting a performance, but then again, she's been around for a while. The men are, as usual, cookie cutter and unmentionable.<br /><br />What I think is too bad is that the movie set itself up for interesting scenes, but then pulls back to the basic mid-range bed shots for the lovemaking. Why bother? Height's romp in the inn's kitchen is a good example. Rather than going whole hog 9 1/2 weeks-style with the props at their displosal, Height and her female friend (Taylor St. Clair) bump and grind on the counter. Again, watching Height is an experience (all 3 of her sex scenes have a definite attraction to them), but couldn't they have done something more?<br /><br />Many watchers of this film will see other wasted opportunities. Given the physical talents of the cast, it just seems to be a waste to go to all this trouble, then not do something more interesting with them than what turns up.\n",

            "The Enforcer, whose French title is La femme à abattre, plays often to packed houses in Paris. More than one French critic has called the film a gem (un joyau) among film noir classics. Indeed, its popularity in France says lots about pure plot lines and straightforward characterizations which make the film accessible to non-English-speaking audiences. As many readers know, the French are crazy about American film noir, and it's common to see parents bring their children to see movies like The Enforcer. I recently sat next to such a family when the film played in March 2003 at the Grand Action cinéma in Paris. It was almost moving to hear the father explain to his son that they would be seeing a film which, in his words, is a classic with great insights in the American psyche. Hearing them speak made me wonder how many American families use films of decades past to teach their children about the world in which we live.<br /><br />By the way, the three cinémas in the Action chain in Paris regularly play American films noirs and other classic American movies, many of them in newly restored versions.<br /><br />Don Ediger\n",

            "The Little Tramp is chased into a circus tent during a performance; his antics prove funnier than those of the clowns, and the ringmaster hires him for the show.<br /><br />When a comedian plays a character who is inadvertently hilarious, it can seem narcissistic: just check out Jerry Lewis's \"The Errand Boy\" where Lewis has his supporting cast praise the comic genius of the character played by Jerry Lewis. Despite this danger, and despite Chaplin's off-screen egotism, the premise plays beautifully, especially since The Little Tramp (though not Chaplin) is such a terrible comedian when he's trying to be one. My favorite moment is when the ringmaster demands the auditioning Tramp to be funny right that instant: the Tramp grins and shyly dances around a bit, gingerly falls down, puts his cane between his legs and meekly lifts himself back up. \"Terrible!\" roars his would-be employer.<br /><br />This film has more self-awareness over comedy conventions that any other Chaplin I know of. The Tramp ineptly (but hilariously) performs a couple of standard comedy routines with the other circus clowns. Later, there's a funny twist to the old banana peel gag; and near the end he crashes into an old general store, looking as if he's thrust himself back into his old Keystone days. This is Chaplin's last true silent film, and the Keystone moment feels like a nostalgic farewell to the past.<br /><br />\"The Circus\" is funny throughout, but the opening scenes are probably the best. There's a marvelous funhouse sequence and a priceless routine where The Tramp pretends to be a motorized dummy. (Has anyone seen the Swiss clock routine from \"Your Show of Shows\"?) He also falls in love with the ringmaster's cruelly treated daughter, which leads to a poignant ending.<br /><br />I enjoyed the music, which Chaplin composed for this film in 1969. His scores are always repetitive; but they're also sweet and funny and they enhance the action. I could have done without the title-sequence song (which he sings himself)something about looking up at rainbows. Otherwise, this comedy is near-perfect and holds its own against Chaplin's even greater features, \"The Gold Rush,\" \"City Lights\" and \"Modern Times.\"\n",

            "I see I am clearly in the minority here and it wouldn't be the first time, but I just didn't find this movie all that entertaining. Maybe this movie has a cult following that I don't get.<br /><br />Firstly, the acting was atrocious. Now, that could have been the intent, but if so, I never got that impression. The dialogue was delivered so mechanical, most times it seemed like the actors were reading directly from cue cards.<br /><br />Secondly, this movie had no direction. Where was this movie going? Again, maybe I missed the intent, but was it just to capture the dull and pathetic life of a clerk and those around him? I don't expect every movie to have a mighty and life altering message, but at least have a loftier aim than go to work, have a screwed up day and go home.<br /><br />Finally, there was entirely too much profanity. It was to the degree that it had no more impact. If vulgarity is going to be used, then using it sparingly can make it funnier and have more of an impact on the script. The flagrant use of profanity in this movie just made the movie juvenile and childish.<br /><br />Overall the movie just didn't move me. I laughed very little, there was nothing to think about, and there were no magnificent or even decent performances. I did like one scene though, and that was the different take on \"The Return of the Jedi\". I thought that was an interesting and funny take on the movie, but I also think that-that could have been done in a short film. Cut this movie down to a five minute short film about the innocent independent contractors on the Death Star and the movie is a lot better in my opinion.\n",

At first, I thought it was a movie about college, since all the actors were so old and just walked in and out of classrooms at their leisure, but then I was stunned that they were suppose to be high school age. They are all obviously in their twenties and looked ridiculous as teenagers...it's like casting white people to play blacks in a movie, just as out of place and ridiculous. Next, the movie plays on it's vagueness, we don't understand the motivations behind any of these characters and the dialogue comes off as contrived and phony. Finally, for a film that was supposed to be set in the seventies, it truly fails to capture any feel for that era, it seems more modern than anything in dialogue and appearance.

She Ra is a pretty cool character, and this episode is pretty good.<br /><br />At birth Adam had a twin sister named Adora. However the Hoard invaded Eternia, led by an evil guy named Hordak, and took Adora away from her family and to the planet of Etheria. Hordak turns Adora into a member of his troops who is an important leader. Many years later, the sorceress informs He-Man that he is to go to the planet Etheria and give a special sword to someone. By this time, a rebellion is going on in Etheria.<br /><br />I must say that there are tons of similarities to Star Wars. Twins that are composed of one boy and one girl being separated at birth, spaceships attacking, and a rebellion going on. Yep, definitely very similar to Star Wars.<br /><br />I think that the idea of He-Man having a sister is interesting. However, this is the first time that it is ever mentioned. I think it works out though. I guess that the fact that only Man at Arms, The King and QUeen, and Skeletor were the only characters that knew about Adora makes the fact that it never came up work.<br /><br />The story of this episode is good. THere is a lot of build up and action along the way. It really takes a while for She-Ra to emerge using the sword.<br /><br />She-Ra is pretty cool. Strong, intelligent, and (for a character in a cartoon series) very hot. She has unique abilities in that she can turn her sword into anything she wants.<br /><br />New Villains are introduced in the Hoard and Hordak. Hordak is pretty evil and it is cool how he can turn into a jet. Hordak also has a great army composed of mechanical soldiers and a bunch of weird creatures. This includes Manteena, Leach, Catra, and some Scorpion Lady. Catra is cool and so is Mantena, but I think Hordaks warriors are not nearly as cool as Skeletors.<br /><br />I have one major complaint. I always thought that Skeletor was always an evil leader who only answered to himself. However in this episode it is revealed that he was once Hordak's padawan(star wars term). It just does not look like Skeletor belongs to the Hoard and it made more sense for him to not be involved with the Hoard. Skeletor answers to Skeletor, not the Hoard. So, kind of a lame way to connect Skeletor and Hordak. Should have left them separate.<br /><br />Having three sisters, I can relate to this episode and how He-Man is happy to see his sister. Kind of touches close to home for me.<br /><br />Great episode and introduction of She-Ra. Recommended cartoon.\n",

            "Somehow in line with \"Calendar Girls\" and \"Mrs Henderson Presents\" as it deals with the sex life of elderly ladies, \"Irina Palm\" is the story of the slightly-more-than-middle-aged Maggie who has to raise a large sum of money in order to save her grandchild from dying, takes a job as a w*nker in a sex club (minimal physical touch, no nude scenes, all done in the best taste) (... imaginable under the circumstances, that is) - and finds that she has a rare talent for just that sort of work. I liked it. The story is given every conceivable, foreseeable twist and turn - a romance with the sex bar proprietor who just had to sample her talent on the sly; her friends who are dying to be let in on the particulars, but still are too prudish not to turn their backs on her; her son finding out and flying into a rage, and the reconciliation with her hostile daughter-in-law when she learns about Maggie's sacrifice - all predictable, but still: I liked it. Perhaps because everybody in the film puts out great performance. Miki Manoljovic is very good as the sex bar owner who falls in love with his unlikely ace employee, Kevin Bishop is frighteningly good as the loving, mild-mannered son who cannot really see his way through to understand his mother (which son could, given her line of work?), and Marianne Faithful, that rarely seen blast from the past (my past, at least) is certainly a far cry from her Ophelia in 1969 (Yes, I do know that she's been doing bits and bobs in between, but somehow I've missed them). Marianne Faithful's slow, slightly hazy style is recognizable still, and I'd say she carries this film through in a very touching way - no pun intended.\n",

But instead Adolphe gives him an assignment in wooing Loretta Young and posing as an Russian count at the same time.<br /><br />That's basically the idea behind this charming film. In fact, the whole film really does rely on its stars' charm and Ms. Young's loveliness. They're not given much to do and for that matter this isn't what I'd call a funny movie. Based on an idea by actor/director Gregory Ratoff, who has a supporting role, the movie drags in the second half. Looking back on it, I feel now like I am giving it a hard time, but there wasn't much to it, really.<br /><br />Watch \"Day-Time Wife\" first (both can be found on DVD together on a 10-movie set of Ty's.) For its production values, I give \"Cafe\" a '4,' but don't expect to be falling out of your seats.\n",

            "If you enjoyed the film versions of Ghost in the Shell and are worried that a TV version will be an inferior product you shouldn't be, Stand Alone Complex is excellent, and as it takes place in an alternate time line to the films Major Motoko Kusanagi is once again leading the operational side of Section Nine.<br /><br />Each series has twenty six episodes, some following a main story line, others which which are self contained, some of these tell us about the characters' pasts. The series is lighter in tone than the film but still exciting when it needs to be. Some viewers might not be too keen on the addition of the Tachikoma, small blue tanks with cute voices, I too felt that way initially but grew to like them more and more as the series progressed. As this was made for television the Major keeps her clothes on far more than in the film, she does however wear a rather revealing costume in the first series.<br /><br />An exciting story well told is helped by really good animation accompanied by a great sound track. I really liked the characters, especially the Major, it was nice to get to know them better than the shorter film format allowed. I would certainly recommend this, not just to people who enjoyed the films but also to any fan of exciting science fiction.<br /><br />Don't switch off when the end credits start as after the credits for each episode there is a short \"Tachikomatic Days\" story, a little comedy sketch featuring the Tachikoma.<br /><br />These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.\n",

            "Screwed will not go down in history as a landmark film; it does not have Oscar-caliber elements or even a plausible story. But, uh.... what were you expecting from a screw ball comedy? Screwed is absolutely hilarious - screw ball comedy at its best.<br /><br />The great Norm MacDonald stars as Willard Fillmore, the loyal but disgruntled butler to pastry tycoon Miss Crock (played superbly by Elaine Stritch). Following his deceased father's advice (\"Stick with Miss Crock, you'll get ahead\") Willard has remained retained by Miss Crock despite being despised and abused (\"Suddenly I realized, that, uh, I don't have a pension plan, I don't have a health plan, I don't have a dental plan....\"). Finally, Willard cannot take it anymore and after a ho-ho-hellish eruption at Crock on Christmas Eve he discovers that he will be fired the next day. So Willard and his best bud, restaurant manager Rusty P. Hayes (played by the hilarious Dave Chappelle), set out to give Miss Crock the big screw: steal her beloved Pomeranian and hold him for ransom for one million dollars. But things get complicated when the dog gets away and returns home Toto-style, all the while signs of a scuffle and a ransom note (\"Pay us one million dollars or he's a dead dog\") are left behind, leaving Miss Crock and the police to believe that Willard was kidnapped. From here events get even more complicated and screwy.<br /><br />The reason Screwed is so funny and ultimately works well as an overall film can be credited, in a very large part, to the perfect casting. Norm MacDonald and Dave Chappelle are two of my very favorite comedians and they make a great comedic team. Both are absolutely hilarious with exclusively individual comedic styles: MacDonald has a knack for delivering zany and ridiculous comedy in as dry of a way as possible and Chappelle is very loud and animated as only he can be. Plus, both MacDonald and Chappelle are just great leads, making each character their very own. MacDonald especially does a great job, I really do not buy into the idea that MacDonald is a comic who cannot act - he is incredibly expressive in this film.<br /><br />The great casting does not end with MacDonald and Chappelle however. 3-time Emmy winner Elaine Stritch is excellent as the grumpy and selfish Miss Crock. Stritch is a stitch - she plays a vain old woman but does it in a hilariously bombastic way while managing to create sympathy for her mean character. Also, Danny Devito is outrageous as creepy diener Grover Cleaver and Daniel Benzali is great as the \"evil Cojack\" Detective Tom Dewey trying to solve the case - familiar faces Sherman Hemsley and Sarah Silverman also co-star.<br /><br />The two-headed writer/directing team of Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (writers of Ed Wood, Man On The Moon, The People vs. Larry Flint) are the force behind the film. Most of the story is implausible and most sane people would not do what most of the characters in the film do. However, Alexander and Karaszewski do create one extremely funny film with many great gags, situations, and characters. Willard and Rusty are stupid - there are no two ways about it - but the characters are so likable and funny, thanks in large part to MacDonald and Chappelle, and it is easy to go along with them for the ride.<br /><br />Screwed might be a far-fetched comedy - maybe even a stupid one - but it is very funny, and what else would you want it to be?\n",

There are lots of preachy/teachy speeches at first, before the murder, and then a full obsession into finding the killers. As obvious as the storyline was, and as overwrought the acting was, I was sucked in nonetheless, to see how it ended, even though you could see it coming from miles and miles away. It was just awful.

            "Starting with the positive: X is pretty to look at and has a great premise - the two opposing sides that make up the narrative have valid reasons for doing what they do, rather than the \"we're good and they're evil\" style of anime plot writing that is very common. Try as I might, those are the only redeeming features of this movie.<br /><br />X may be an incomplete manga series at the time of filming, but that doesn't mean you can release an incomplete film. Trying to squeeze too much into X has meant that a lot of it doesn't have any point - while the characters are easily distinguishable in terms of their powers, they don't do enough to actually mean anything to the audience. The narrative just runs along at breakneck speed, hoping to distract the audience through constant fight scenes. While I appreciated the mortality rate of the characters in X (as opposed to the cliches of being beaten down to a pulp but then coming back and winning) it was just like watching meat through a grinder - I didn't care when they went in and didn't care when they came out.<br /><br />The metaphysical imagery of X is also very peculiar, mixing a lot of Christian iconography with rivers of blood and gore. It was something different, but different doesn't mean good in this case.<br /><br />My final gripe was that the closest thing this movie had to a twist was simply unbelievable. It flew in the face of what little characterization had been created, then the film ends not with a bang but with a half-hearted sigh. It left me wondering if I had missed something vital, but not caring to endure a repeat performance. <br /><br />Pretty but very pointless, X wasn't worth the rental.\n",

            "The role of the paranoid-mystic and abused soldier Wozzeck is a perfect character for Klaus Kinski. Herzog is right not to interfere too much with this portrayal (and Kinski is in almost every shot) by simply setting up the camera and standing back. Kinski is typically intense, but he manages to glaze this with a perpetual preoccupation with something else, something as if off-camera.<br /><br />The problem is, there's nothing off-camera. The script is very close from Buchner's play but nothing in Herzog's production reflects it. There is none of the expressionism suggested by the DVD cover/advertising poster. The general look of the production is period-realist and close-framed. The action jumps, unmoderated, from one scene to the next, often losing a sense of dramatic causality. Herzog's strict adherence to the text eschews the opportunities afforded by film and left me feeling rather bereft...<br /><br />The crisp, document-realism of this film has only one sequence modulated with music - the one addition that could really transform it. Clearly, a production of Berg's opera on the same material has music built into it (and what music!) and, notably, music inbetween the scenes, providing the breadth and rumination that Herzog has stubbornly refused. It's a satisfactory reproduction of Buchner's text but, Kinski aside, not much more than that. 4/10\n",

A little longer than it should be, but it doesn't drag, and the situation is a hook even though contrived. Then again, it was pretty contrived when Woolrich wrote it. This version avoids the depths of cosmic bleakness in Woolrich's vision and makes for a satisfying entertainer. On the IMDb scale, 7/10 from me.<br /><br />\n",

            "\"Lust, Caution\" is a picture of the power of tremendous forces on that which is ultimately unable to bear the strain: a picture of a tidal wave crushing victims, or of a hurricane ripping through buildings.<br /><br />There have been many reviews of how this movie suffers in intrigue, and lacks in the typical Hollywood excitement and fireworks. *This is not simply a spy flick!* These reviewers might also observe a natural disaster and comment on how the buildings were all poorly constructed and the victims too weak to provide sufficient excitement and entertainment.<br /><br />Tang Wei, Ang Lee & co have put together a brilliant depiction of a dark and haunting time when the common person was buffeted and often destroyed by the struggle between titanic powers, emotions, and ideas.<br /><br />Tang Wei as Wang Jiazhi stands out especially as a perfect victim for the emotional and psychological blows that she suffers from the beginning to her last moments on camera. Floundering in the maelstrom of the time, Wang Jiazhi fights valiantly to grasp at something, anything to justify her existence. The sacrifices she makes and trials she endures become a dark and painful comedy of errors that will be even more poignant for those who can understand her predicament and the times Wang Jiazhi lives in. Each time, Wang convinces herself to plunge headlong into her endeavors:<br /><br />********spoilers start***********<br /><br />1. She sacrifices safety for the chance at love, achieving only a passing admiration and infatuation. 2. She discards innocence (with the worst possible candidate) for a patriotic cause, gaining only a bloody consolation for a lost prize. 3. She sells her inheritance for a chance to study, only to be forced to learn something she despises. 4. She suffers the unspeakable for a chance to complete a mission, only to be drawn in by the enemy. 5. Coming full circle, she compromises the mission for the hope of love and safety, throwing away life and the respect of friends in one fell moment.<br /><br />*********Spoilers end**************<br /><br />The failures of Wang Jiazhi pursuits are shocking to point of comedy at times, just as one might gasp and laugh coldly in near disbelief at extreme tragedy and carnage. However, Wang Jiazhi's story is one that would only be all too common in that day and age.<br /><br />While the NC-17++ scenes do contribute to the raw and poignant artistry of the the movie, the storyline and acting is enrapturing in and of itself. The sophisticated and empathic audience is sure to find this film a winner that will haunt their thoughts long after more foolish viewers have lost interest.\n",

            "A young girls turning 18 and discovering her womanhood. Her older sister, willing to sacrifice her life in order to get her family out of poverty. Their father, an ill-tempered and drunken author with a severe case of writer's block. Their stepmother whose livelihood depends on closeness with an artist. One dashing American who can marry one sister and take the whole family out of its plight. The American's brother, who doesn't necessarily agree with his sibling's choice. Set the story in England in the 1930's and you've pretty much woven the tapestry for this lovely tale of poverty, hope, dreams and love.<br /><br />Cassandra, convincingly played by Romola Garai, is the pillar of this poor English family. A family that is constantly hoping and waiting for the father to publish a second great novel, the novel that will finally bring decent food on the table and acceptable clothes on their back. During this maddening wait, Cassandra writes her most intimate thoughts and feelings in her diary and brings us along the roller-coaster ride that is the passage from childhood to womanhood.<br /><br />The movie takes place in rural England, in an old castle. The camera work is fabulous. Blazing sunshine in good times and rain and clouds as life becomes more of a burden. The 1930's costumes are impeccable and make you wish you could have lived then, when men still knew how to wear suits, and women could look feminine and sexy without looking trashy.<br /><br />I haven't read Dodie Smith's novel, but I've yet to see a movie adaptation that was better than the book. By these standards, the novel must be a formidable read.<br /><br />I don't know what it is with English films. Being in North America, I've always heard that the English have a stiff upper lip and that they don't show any emotions. Yet, some of the most touching films and love stories I've seen were English (Sense and Sensibility comes to mind, here -- OK, Ang Lee isn't technically English but the screenplay and novel were; that's close enough in my book).<br /><br />If you like funny, emotional and touching stories, without the loud music, the fake emotions and the telegraphed ending, you will enjoy this film immensely.\n",

First off, one must sit through Lloyd Kaufman's increasingly annoying rants, and then, the pay off, a really bad movie. Gosh, what more could you ask for? Plenty, really.<br /><br />There is no attempt here for any actors to look like the ages they're supposed to be, with horrible wigs, fake mustaches, etc. The only ones that fare well in their roles are the ones that are SUPPOSED to be teenagers, so they kind of look like it.<br /><br />The gist is that there's a campsite that is overrun by raccoons, and they're not just any raccoons, they're raccoons with a taste for human flesh. Which is, in itself, a great idea for a horror movie parody, but the rest of what goes on is so amateur and rinky-dink that it just defeats any other purpose.<br /><br />The raccoons themselves are all real, but obviously deceased, and someone provides evil little chuckles for the things as they pop up here & there.<br /><br />There are a couple almost funny moments, like one teen losing his virginity to the girl of his dreams, while she's being attacked by raccoons....the realization of her plight while he's still busy is probably the highlight of the movie, such as it is.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is going to watch it without the benefits of some heavy-duty substance abuse, in which case it might be worth a chuckle or two. I, however, haven't done that stuff in a long time so I was merely envisioning putting this one straight into the trade-in pile when I was done watching it. 2 out of 10.\n",

            "The real leap forward that Charlie Chaplin made in screen comedy, the thing that put him ahead of his peers, was that he staged his comedy within a straight and serious world. His first two Keystone pictures had little plot but allowed his little tramp to interact (chaotically) with a realistic environment, albeit with a handful of supporting comedy characters thrown in. With the Champion he moved on to develop stronger story lines which were not funny in themselves, but which gave the tramp a world to be funny in.<br /><br />The set-up of an up-and-coming boxer who fights his way to the top, is then bribed into throwing a fight and has to choose between his integrity and the payoff was an established cliché even back then. This well-known sequence of events allows Chaplin to mess around with stereotypes or subvert conventions. For a start, there is the fact that Charlie is a scrawny little feller, who essentially cheats his way to the championship. Then there's the farcical training routine, which Chaplin cross-cuts with the opponents more serious routine to give it more comedy impact, followed by the tramp's nonchalant seeing-off of Leo White's over-the-top sinister villain.<br /><br />Throughout Chaplin is showing more confidence in his staging and arrangements. He allows himself to become a more marginal figure in some sequences  for example when Spike Duggan is knocking out one challenger after another, Charlie isn't doing very much, and is off-screen half the time, but it's his reactions to the growing number of defeated men that is funny. The other characters simply act naturally, whereas Chaplin is the originator of all the comedy.<br /><br />In Chaplin's previous picture, A Night Out, he came dangerously close to becoming a double-act with Essanay's resident comic Ben Turpin. A large part of Chaplin's humour was based on reacting to other comedy characters, so he needed to have his supporting cast of burly bullies and pompous twerps to antagonise. However in the Champion you can see he is being careful not to let any of them have too much screen time. Although Bud Jamison, Leo White and Ernest van Pelt all do a great job, each of them is a walk-on, walk-off character; none of them shares the picture with Charlie. Ben Turpin has a tiny part as a vendor, but even in this one-shot role he manages to violate Chaplin's rule of the tramp being at the comedic centre of attention, stealing the laughs as he scrambles over the crowd to reach a customer. This would be Turpin's last picture with Chaplin.<br /><br />And now, we finish with the all-important statistic  Number of kicks up the arse: 1 (1 for, 0 against)\n",

Other than that, I can't find much to recommend. The killer isn't very interesting. The mystery elements of the film aren't engrossing. And the kill scenes are poorly done. There's just no tension that is necessary for a good Giallo. And the final reveal of the killer is anything but suspenseful. In the end there are only three people left alive. If two of the characters are being chased by the killer, it doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure out who is under the motorcycle helmet?

His daughter Yasmin (Vilma Banky) is the dancer of the group and is promised to the cutthroat Moor Ghobah (Montague Love). However, Yasmin meets Ahmed (Rudolph Valentino), who is the Sheik's son but she does not know, and they fall in love for each other. When the young couple secretly dates in the ruins of Touggourt, where Yasmin dances, the criminals attack Ahmed, beat up and capture him, expecting to ask for a ransom. Ghobah poisons Ahmed, telling that Yasmin is a bait to lure victims for them. Ahmed escapes, and he abducts Yasmin and despises her. When he knows the truth, he fights against the gang of criminals trying to rescue her from Ghobah.<br /><br />\"The Son of the Sheik\" is the last movie of Rudolph Valentino and a delightful adventure with romance, action and drama. The cinematography is impressive, and I particularly liked very much the sequences when Vilma Banky dances in Touggourt beginning with a close and opening to the whole place, and when Ahmed chases Ghobah and Yasmin in the desert. Considering the equipment available in 1926, big, heavy and with serious limitations, it is amazing how these scenes were shot. Rudolph Valentino is fantastic in the role of the son of the Sheik, and his agility recalled me Errol Flynn, when he fights in the bar of Touggourt, jumping on the chandelier. The beautiful Vilma Banky dances magnificently well, shows a great chemistry with Rudolph Valentino and has also a great interpretation. The intense music of Arthur Gutmann gives a perfect dynamic to this wonderful underrated film. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"O Filho do Sheik\" (\"The Son of the Sheik\")\n",

            "This film is an attempt to revive the once-thriving Cambodian movie-making industry that was decimated by the Khmer Rouge government. Co-produced with Thailand, THE SNAKE KING'S CHILD is based on a folk tale about the child of a peasant woman and a snake god.<br /><br />For westerners, the film's main attractions are visual. The cinematography is often striking, with atmospheric use of colour and shadow. All the characters wear eye-catching costumes. Actual Cambodian locations were used for many of the beautiful settings. Most memorable of all is Pich Chan Barmey's fabulous snake-hair effect, which easily outstrips any of the unconvincing attempts in western movies to portray gorgons.<br /><br />Whether THE SNAKE KING'S CHILD will succeed in resurrecting Cambodian movie-making remains to be seen, but it certainly constitutes a promising start.<br /><br />A letterboxed DVD, with rather eccentric English subtitles, has been released by Hong Kong's Winson Entertainment.\n",

            "PEYTON PLACE has had quite a reputation as a book and a movie. The movie is BASED on the book, and is NOT the book. In my opinion, the film is much better. Attitudes have changed and I can imagine what the film would be like if it were re-made. What was implied in the book would be glorified on the screen. Besides, the film makers of today can't hold a candle to the film makers of yore. Small town scandal has been a topic for movies forever and a day, but none better than PEYTON PLACE. The acting is first rate, especially by DIANE VARSI; HOPE LANGE and LANA TURNER in the lead female roles. The male roles are a bit underdeveloped and LEE PHILLIPS seems a bit off as Michael Rossi. However, the more I see the film the more he grows on me, as does the entire film. The location sites are great as is the cinematography. The lush score by Franz Waxman really seals the films brilliance. This movie must be seen on the wide-screen with stereo sound for the full impact and appreciation. PEYTON PLACE clocks in at 2 hours and 37 mins., but could have been longer. The only distraction is the rear projection for Lana Turners exterior scenes. It's quite obvious she did not go on location. There are even doubles for her in the long shots. Besides these minor distractions, PEYTON PLACE is a must repeat viewing again and again. A shame the career of Diane Varsi stalled so quickly after three more films. I went to school with her sister, Gail, and I'm know she would have gone on to stardom if she had the chance. She was equally talented.\n",

            "Director Roberta Findley, wife of cult legend Michael, directs yet another bizarre, cheaply made, vulgar film. This one, Lurkers, named for the dead that can be seen by some \"lurking\" about, primarily tells the tale of a girl having a bad home life in New York in an apartment house where she sees these lurkers. We are introduced to her in a somewhat inventive and at the same time crude opening sequence where the young girl, having just been verbally/physically abused by her mother, goes outside to play and while playing jump rope - the rope mysteriously entwines around her neck as the children idly smile and watch. A young woman who will be seen later in the movie arrives, and the rope stops. Quickly we move to the present when the young girl has turned into a young musician in love with a photographer. The film then relates this relationship - but to say any more would give away the plot. And I wouldn't want to do that to you - or would I(might save you!) I think of all about this film that I did like - and granted that was not much - was the story. It is somewhat talky and you soon know where it is going, but it has shades reminiscent of Rosemary's Baby with regards to the man-woman relationship and a future conspiracy. I even thought the end, reminiscent of The Sentinel, was just quirky enough to be interesting. The real problem with this movie is that it never can shake the cheap look and feel it has. This can be easily seen in the settings, the lack of good, quality actors, and the special effects(what few there are). Christine Moore plays the lead - and she is pretty - but beyond that nothing very special. She is better than virtually everyone else in the film. Findley also has some obvious, how shall we say, peculiar interests as we are shown various scenes suggesting sexual aberration of some kind and scenes suggesting sick violence with a sledge hammer. The film is not particularly gory though. One scene that stood out for me was a scene between two beautiful models - both highly attractive - disrobing and talking about the stock market. It has nothing to do with anything yet has an interesting humorous edge as well as other pluses aimed to peak one's interest.\n",

The story line is very strong and I didn't feel the need to turn to something more interesting which I find often happens with this type genre. It is well thought out, and has some great moments. I would recommend this to friends, which would be more to an adult audience, as the film does contain a couple of scenes which are not family viewing. If you're a Montgomery fan who hasn't seen this yet, then put it on the top of the list, because it's a brilliantly moving film, and her performance is well done.\n",

This is a mid-50s movie, but much of it really felt like it was in the 60s. The styles, the art direction, the camera shots, were, for this movie, ahead of their time. But for a Bing Crosby buddy movie, it failed. First, it was overly sexualized with sexual overtones and currents throughout the whole film. Secondly, many of the songs and dance numbers felt tacked-on to the plot (which started to wear thin quickly). The dialog and humor were sub-par, and the ending felt tacked on as well. The last thirty minutes seemed to be a rush to an ending that really failed once you got there. I think Bing gave it his all, and he never faltered. But trying to shove a classic Bing buddy film into this mold leaves you with a weird and tiresome movie.\n",

            "This is NOT a gay romance, or gay love story (even though there is a kiss and some meaningful / longing looks). I never developed a feeling I was seeing true romantic love. However, I was often noting something that purported to be religious love. So, no, you're not going to see any memorably well-done love scenes such as witnessed in the movie, \"Shelter\" (definitely need more films like that one). Instead, this is a \"Message Film\".....a tale of persons / organizations who aim to remold who people are----to remake people's innermost selves. BUT.......as a viewer you should remain aware that, in the end, such a goal is not going to be successful. Still, there will be cases / instances of supposedly successful personality change presented in order to convince us otherwise (just know that if personality alterations are brought about, they will be surface ones only).<br /><br />Through the way this film has been set up, and especially in its ending, it is almost as though we are being expected to just accept that a deep romantic love was / had been taking place. Well, I'm sorry; I didn't sense it happening between characters, Mark and Scott. Lips meeting, dancing with one another, building bird houses together are not enough for me; they are all just surface acts. The two actors filling these roles weren't able to produce that \"magic\"......that \"whatever-it-is\" which I was given in the film, \"Shelter.\" In that movie, I knew I had watched love begin and grow. (Interesting then, isn't it, that \"Shelter\" contains the heterosexual leads and \"Save Me\" the gay ones). Admittedly, I do recognize that perhaps most of \"Save Me\" was not written / planned to focus on a \"couple\" but, rather, was aimed at exposing overzealousness by some in the religious community and their need to \"reform\" homosexuals. Having said this, I'll now step aside and leave commenting on that aspect of this production to filmgoers far more qualified than I.<br /><br />As to the performers, a subject on which I'm able to comment: Judith Light is near-phenomenal (you'll never, never, ever relate her to that TV \"Ugly Betty\" role). Here, before your very eyes, she BECOMES the message of this film. No one else can touch her. We can see Chad Allen trying, as we watch him with her in their one-on-one scenes. Sitting together in a truck at one point, we can almost see his efforts to absorb and keep up with what Light is putting out there----a special ability of hers that not all actors possess. Yet, in his own way, Allen does acquit himself quite well in this film. Then.....there's Robert Gant: I've followed much of Bobby's performing, from his 2002 \"Providence\" (TV) performance, on up to today. My best impression / description of his acting style is that it's a \"tentative\" one; he's tentative, subdued. It's like you're always waiting for him to break out----but he almost never takes you to that point. In the end, that's frustrating for an audience. And yet.......few actors project \"sincerity\" in a character any better than Gant does. In one last point about another longtime thesp, Stephen Lang comes across very admirably.......and when you're able to do that when playing against Light's extraordinary performance, you really are accomplishing something.<br /><br />To say that this is not a good film, I cannot do. But I expected more.........I hoped for more. (This will not make it to my \"Addictive\" DVD shelves).<br /><br />****\n",

The rather complex ending had its' good and bad points - the coming-out speech could've been sharper (this would've perhaps heightened the emotional tension of the scene), but I found the ending to be otherwise quite satisfactory - Steven, as a self-aware young gay man, possesses a strength and self-assurance that places him far ahead of John, whose cowardly retreats into violence betray a confusion that will only create problems in other people's lives until he gains the strength to work things out for himself. No strong, self-aware human being should ever need to put up with getting literally kicked around, which Steven is smart enough to already know, which his why he can ride off into the sunset loveless but confident - such a liberated ending (while no 'happily-ever-after' romance) more than validates the occasional 'after-school-special' moments that preceded it.<br /><br />There are many moments here that could form the basis for any number of provocative follow-ups: the contradictions of John, or the relationships - supportive or otherwise - with parents (grossly under-explored in gay drama) or teachers. Overall GET REAL isn't flawless, but it's many perceptive moments of both sweetness and intelligence very much make it worth seeing.\n",

From the characters who inhabit the theatre world of the day to the laissez faire attitude of the court of Charles II, we gain a privileged view into an age of bawdy good humour.<br /><br />The lead parts are played in great style by the enormously accomplished Billy Crudup and Claire Danes who create a sense of true chemistry between them. Crudup's acting is deserving of an Oscar, although sadly it seems unlikely that the Academy will take too much notice of a relatively small budget film and will, as usual, hand out awards for Hollywood blockbusters. The supporting cast are also excellent with Rupert Everett being born to play the tolerant, witty and womanising King.<br /><br />The tight direction of the film is a credit to Richard Eyres and the pace never flags for a moment. There has obviously been much historical research gone into the background of the story which has paid off handsomely. The score keeps pace with the action and the story gallops along to its breathtaking conclusion.<br /><br />We should urge everyone we know to go to see Stage Beauty at least twice and to harangue the Academy into awarding this gem of a movie a clutch of Oscars!\n",

Those shrews really do deserve to be seen on a full sized theater screen.\n",

            "I don't understand how this movie could acquire so many positive reviews. The fact is this movie is utterly predictable from the very first opening scene to the ending credits. Storyline, acting, and the music all serving up a feeling of I have seen and heard this many times before.<br /><br />The film portrays the internet as a place where surfers only enjoy seeing other people suffer. I guess to anyone not familiar or has used the internet would watch this movie and then happily advocate internet controls which would basically be a system controlled by government. Of course this is something to be resisted because the Internet has become the last bastion of free speech.<br /><br />I couldn't wait for this movie to end simply because I knew exactly how it was going to and indeed did pan out. I must also say that it wouldn't have mattered which character bought the farm in this movie because I couldn't care less about any of them.<br /><br />The message in this movie is that we have become a society with zero morals (which could in fact be correct)but the sickest of all are the internet users where the only joy they will get is to watch humans suffering live on TV or the internet. I believe this is an extremely cynical point of view and what this movie actually promotes is what it portrays to be against.<br /><br />The only thing this movie will do is simply add to the frenzy of calls to have the internet controlled by government who will duly oblige given the chance. Well they are already trying to get it done by spreading fear of identity theft and in general the gullible masses are now beginning to believe that the moment they input their credit card details in to a computer their immediately a victim of identity theft. But as well all know, or at least all of us who use the internet for many reasons including and what I consider to be the most important of all and that is to seek out the truth when it comes to news the internet is in fact the last bastion of free speech, well in Europe it most definitely is.<br /><br />My negative review isn't because I fear this movie is shocking enough to have governments reaching for the control switch. In fact the movie isn't shocking at all. Its just a plain bad movie from start to finish. If you like predictable poorly written scripts and movies with no character depth and sanitised death scenes you will like this. To me it stank to high heaven of a made for TV movie\n",

            "Battlestar Galactica did have a heavy impact on my childhood. I remember all of my friends trying to rebuild Battlestars and Vipers in various designs out of our LEGO space edition tiles. And how much fun it was to blast the other's ships into pieces! LEGO must have earned millions through us. Never ever has there been another spacecraft as illustrious in design as the Galactica (forget Star Trek's clumsy saucers). Unfortunately, the special effects appeared a little simple, because they were persistently reused. And YES, another commentator was right: Maren Jenson is THE reason to watch the show! Of course, there are one or two things about the story which are quite dubious. For one, the praised military leadership being better than a civilian one is a little hard-core cold-war belief. And in the series, those partially overemphasized religious elements sometimes got a little annoying in the otherwise splendid science-fantasy plot. But after all, those elements formed a heterogeneous mix promoting tolerance and gave the show its uniqueness. Definitely worth watching!\n",

The fact that it is based on short story by Dashiell Hammett puts in a class above the rest with a story-line that is frighteningly plausible. Boasting a stellar cast including Samuel L Jackson, Stellan Skasgaard and Milla Jovovich it is highly suspenseful with a cracking script. Stellan Skasgaard delivers his lines with relish and Milla Jovovich is highly believable in her role as a woman who plays all the men against each other. Grace Zabriskie and Joss Ackland steal the show, however, with their portrayals of a thief-couple in their twilight years. All, in all, highly recommended for a nights entertainment for those who like their thrillers a little more cerebral than the norm.\n",

Basically Dennis Mitchell (Liar Liar's Justin Cooper) still causes misery for old neighbour George Wilson (Toy Story's Don Rickles), his wife Martha (Betty White) likes her and keeps reminding him he's a child. Mr. Wilson wishes Dennis could bother another old man, and along comes Grandpa (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot's George Kennedy) to take him out a little bit, but it is obvious he doesn't have as much time as he thought. Mr. Wilson isn't just worrying about how Dennis will make his life misery, he is worried that he is ageing too quickly, and cons the Professor (Brian Doyle-Murray) and Sylvester (Scott 'Carrot Top' Thompson) who in various disguises are trying to trick him into giving them loads of his money. Dennis meanwhile is not only causing chaos for Mr. Wilson and one or two other people in the neighbourhood, but he can't rid of \"girlfriend\" Margaret (Jacqueline Steiger), who wants to marry him. Dennis catches on to the con artists sponging off Mr. Wilson, and he saves the day in the end, and Mr. Wilson sees that Dennis does have his good side, for about ten minutes. Also starring Dwier Brown as Henry Mitchell, Heidi Swedberg as Alice Mitchell and Spy Kids' Alexa Vega as Gina. Cooper might be cute as the disaster prone little troublemaker, and the sequence where he tries to wash a car with candy floss mix instead of pink soap was amusing, but young Steiger is like the four-eyed equivalent of Annie, i.e. irritating, and it is a dull story, unfunny and just an overall boring family comedy.

            "Battlefield: Earth By Dean Kish<br /><br />\tDreadlocked aliens turn mankind into an endangered species. Guess whose their leader? Battlefield: Earth is the adaptation of the best-selling science fiction novel of the same name. Written by scientologist guru Ron L Hubbard, Battlefield tells the story of the universe conquering Psychlos who are bent on gathering as much profit for their empire as possible. Unthreatened by a `man-animal' named Johnny, the Psychlos decide to rape the Earth of its last natural resources. Once completed the entire population humans will be eliminated. It's up to Johnny to free his people and lead a revolt. I guess the best way to describe this film is comparing it to other sci-fi classics of the past. The world Johnny struggles to free is right out of that great classic cartoon series from the 80s called `Thundarr the Barbarian' or even `Planet of the Apes'. The Psychlos are a mixture of Klingons and Ferengi from Star Trek. The dogfight scenes are classically ripped off of films like `Independence Day' and `Godzilla'. It seems each and every element in this film originated somewhere else. Hubbard may have come up with this concept before these other references but with such a saturated sci-fi market they look like pale imitations.<br /><br />\tAs I watch John Travolta walking around looking like a Jamaican trapped in a KISS video, it makes me wonder was this the project he envisioned when trying so hard to get this sci-fi film off the ground. He produced and had a huge take in this film's success. His character is devilish but so over the top arrogant I wonder if he is supposed to be laughed at throughout the film. I know I laughed pretty hard. As for other star Barry Pepper, he is able to unlock some charisma in his unoriginal `gung-ho' character. At least we feel a little for the guy. What bugged me is that when he sends one of his men to his doom we never see an ounce of emotion. I did however find that with every character in this film. Also some of the language and dialogue was so ridiculous you would often scratch your head in disbelief that it was actually said. For instance, they claim to have wiped out the human race in 9 minutes but they never think to scout the civilization for raw materials. How could aliens this dumb reign so supreme? Battlefield: Earth is one of those sci-fi films where you pray the novel is better than the film. If this is a classic story or novel no one ever told me. If this is a must see for you this summer, I recommend waiting for the next sci-fi flick. (1.5of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.\n",

            "Why are British films so over rated? This film (which may be obscure to most people outside the u.k) is considered a classic by the British public and some critics. I was looking forward to watching it, even though I have grown wary of British films with the 'classic' tag attached. Probably 90% of these films I have found to be over rated and inferior to their Hollywood equivalents. Now don't get me wrong, I am not a big fan of Hollywood either, but compared to British films, they are generally much more entertaining and less self conscious. Anyway getting back to 'Genevieve', I found the experience of watching this almost painful. For a supposed comedy it is very unfunny. The Oscar winning(!) harmonica score is annoying and so are the performances by the lead actors. This film tries so hard for the whimsy of, for example the ealing comedies but fails. One thing that really got on my nerves was the constant laughter of the two male competitors, which makes them sound like complete morons. I think the British are very biased when it comes to their own films. Thats the only explanation for immature and extremely CHEESY films like this getting the classic status.\n",

            "The closing credits on this movie rolled more than an hour ago. I still feel soiled.<br /><br />The only good thing about director Des McAnuff's version of Cousin Bette is Jessica Lange's excellent turn as Bette, that misunderstood, underestimated old maid hiding her lifelong rage and jealousy beneath a mask of family loyalty.<br /><br />In all other respects, this adaptation is execrable. Screenwriters Lynn Siefert and Susan Tarr should be banned from ever penning any more literary adaptations.<br /><br />Balzac's Cousin Bette was a masterpiece, an eternal condemnation of the selfishness of vice, achieved through a portrayal of depravity's destruction of virtue. The cinematic version is a mediocre daytime drama in petticoats.<br /><br />The power of the original novel derives from Balzac's use of fascinatingly, unforgettably, tragically human characters to illuminate his pitiless moral: that virtue, nine times out of ten, will fall to the knife in the back of vice. That moral is played out through the characters. And from the pure, pious, and eternally forgiving Adeline Hulot, a wife willing to forgive and forget more than two decades of her adored husband's infidelity, all the way down to the Jewish courtesan Josepha, at once a shameless gold-digger, a great artist, and, at heart, a kind woman, every player in Balzac's grand tragedy plays an irreplaceable part and illuminates an unalterable truth. And it is with the writers' treatment of those characters that McAnuff's Cousin Bette first fails.<br /><br />The greatest tragedy of the novel lies in the gradual abandonment and destruction of the saintly Adeline Hulot. After closing her eyes to two decades of infidelity, she slowly falls from her position into terrible poverty and neglect--one of those illuminations of the destruction of virtue by vice which gives the novel its power. Siefert and Tarr seem not to have grasped this essential point of the source material. Instead of having to deal with the difficulty of a great beauty thrown into the gutter, they have taken the easy way out by killing her off within the first five minutes of the novel. And this without even bothering to pay lip service to the beauty and charm of the woman whose success is the fuel for the fire of Bette's vengefulness. Without Adeline's presence and influence, Bette's envy is pointless. But what else could one expect from screenwriters this illiterate?<br /><br />Next, Siefert and Tarr erased the most fascinating character of the original novel, that of Valerie Marneffe, the middle-class civil servant's wife who is the cause of all of the novel's misfortunes. Valerie was a far more fascinating character than her cinematic replacement, the actress and whore Jenny Cadine. Madame Marneffe's hypocrisy--the truth of her whore's heart disguised by the outward appearance of a virtuous wife--and the complications of her avarice and passion, provided a large part of the entertainment and insight of the novel. Again, Siefert and Tarr have avoided the difficulty of bringing such a multifaceted character to life, simply by cutting her out altogether. Jenny Cadine seems to live for nothing more than a few bouquets of flowers and a pretty dress or two. Not a fraction as compelling.<br /><br />So the characters do not live up to the source material. Neither does the plot, which turns Balzac's masterfully arranged actions and reactions topsy-turvy. Here and there, one may see bits of the original novel struggling to break through--as in Bette's rage when she is told that Wenceslas Steinbock, whom she adores, has secretly entered into a romance with her niece Hortense--but those glimpses are more tragic than anything else, for exposing the greatness that this movie fails miserably to approach.<br /><br />With a series of seemingly natural and inevitable turns of fortune and struggles to escape ruin, Balzac presented a wholly organic portrait of absolute devastation. Siefert and Tarr hope merely to titillate viewers with an exposed female buttock or breast here and there, some pretty costumes and settings, and a few melodramatic situations forced and laughable. Balzac needed no duels to depict rivalry and hatred; he needed no accidental husband-shootings to bring the full force of marital discord home; he needed no sudden descents into madness to prove the ruinousness of deluded obsession. No one hurled dishes to shatter against walls in the novel. No wives were arrested, no sons had to escape from money-lenders promising to \"kill your wife and your child\" when debts were not paid. Those soap-opera devices weren't necessary in the original novel, because the story itself far surpassed them. But Siefert and Tarr need them merely to dress up an utter narrative failure.<br /><br />Cousin Bette, the movie, may indeed appeal to some viewers, those who ask for nothing but sub-The Young and the Restless melodrama dressed up in period costumes. For those of us hoping for a bit more than that--perhaps simply a semi-faithful adaptation of one of the greatest works of the Western canon--it is simply best to stay away. I certainly should have.\n",

The acting itself is very natural.<br /><br />Little weaknesses: because the main characters are all part of one family, they are much alike and it was a little problematic for me to distinguish the different characters in the first 30 minutes; composer Michael Nyman seems to have understood the intimacy of the movie with his score but his music is a little too emphatic. <br /><br />Overall, 'Wonderland' is a very gripping movie, it's a little like a soap opera but much, much better - mostly because of the great cast. I highly recommend this movie. 8/10\n",

            "When I first watched this movie, I thought of it as a \"remake\" of Dial M for Murder. I thought that it was really bad, seeing as how it's a \"remake\". But, after I thought of it as the same theme with a similar story, I started liking it more. I actually saw this before I saw Dial M for Murder, but although this was a good story I still found the original better. The acting in A Perfect Murder was very good. It was much better than I would have ever expected. This movie can't even be compared to Alfred Hitchcock's 'Dial M for Murder'. It still has a good plot. But, I wouldn't think of it as a \"remake\" because I was stuck trying to compare the two movies together, and it made this movie look really bad.\n",

Also, it was very disappointing that the criminal got such a light sentence. Anyone who commits this type of crime should be given harsher penalties otherwise, when they are released, they may just do it again. There just isn't enough being done about identity theft and frauds these days. A slap on the wrist is just not enough. Also, victims should NOT be afraid to fight back harder. Being scared when you see someone commit a crime against you is not going to stop criminals. If this had been me, (thank the Lord it wasn't) she would not have been able to get away. She would not have had the opp. to do some things she did.....\n",

            "Okay, by now we all know that the whole \"Horrorfest 8 Films To Die For\" thing was a shameless ploy. They tried to get people to pay to see movies that, in their words, were \"too terrifying\" for normal audiences. The sad truth is that they were all mediocre horror films that couldn't find distribution and weren't nearly good enough to release on a wide scale. Apparently, some people did go to see them, money was made and the gimmick was fun for the horror fanatics. Long live William Castle.<br /><br />But that was then. Now that they're on DVD, we can all rate and review them for what they are. I've just finished watching one of the eight, Dark Ride, and I have to say that I am astonished and amazed that this movie received ANY kind of release but not for the reason you might think. I didn't mind the dumb plot, the wretched acting, the stupidity of the characters and the retarded ending. I expect all of those things when watching a movie like this. It's part of the fun.<br /><br />My amazement came from watching this and realizing very quickly that the people who made it have absolutely no idea how to shoot a movie. From a technical standpoint, it's an abomination. If you don't believe me, watch it and try to keep track of how many times shots go out of focus because the cameraman (or the director, who can say) has no idea what he's doing. Watch the scene at the gas station and count how many times the camera or the shadow of the camera creeps into the shot. I lost count. At one point, as Jamie-Lynn's character is wandering through the ride, she falls down...and the camera completely misses it. Here's some advice for the director: if you're going to make a movie, hire someone who can pull off the shots you want (by the way, Mr. Singer, you weren't fooling anyone with that awful cut you tried to pull off for the shot of the van's headlight). Most low-budget horror movies come off as amateurish but shoddy, careless film-making like this is inexcusable.<br /><br />Look, I know that there are things that directors do to save time when shooting a low-budget film. One of them is to set the camera up in one spot and capture all of the action from one angle, zooming in to each actor so you can capture all of the coverage without a bunch of different set-ups. The dorm room scene in the beginning is a prime example of this (notice that we only see one side of the room) and so is the gas station scene (once they had the camera on the dolly, they obviously didn't have the time to do another set-up so everything in the parking lot is shot from the left). Why would this bother me, you ask? Because when a film gets ANY kind of theatrical release (even if it's only a week) and the distributor (especially a distributor as big as Lion's Gate) asks people to pay $9.00 to see it, I expect that film to adhere to a certain amount of professionalism. Calling this a professional film is like calling Adolf Hitler a sweetiepie. It just ain't true.<br /><br />Just a couple of things on the DVD that I thought were hilarious. If you look on the back of the DVD box, you'll notice that the word \"attraction\" is spelled wrong (talk about inexcusable and amateurish) and just try not to laugh when, in the special features, one of the writers (the one with the man boobs) admits that it took him four months(!) to write the script.<br /><br />Oh, and I've been around long enough to realize that most of the \"great\" reviews this movie has received on this site (A Classic! A Thrill Ride! Awesome! Old-School Horror At It(sic) Finest!!!) are all from people involved with the film or friends and family of the filmmakers. Guys, that is getting so old. It doesn't fool anybody anymore.\n",

            "Rosalind Russell was just right for this movie. Bette was a great actress, but I cannot imagine her as Auntie Mame. Same with the heroin of Roughly Speaking. Russell played it just right, with a touch of laughter and a touch of pathos. It is about a woman who lives through: Divorce, polio, the Depression, one monetary failure after another, and finally seeing her sons off to fight in WWII. However, you see that it makes her family stronger, they learn to fight thru their problems and come out better for it. It is this movie that made me fall in love with Jack Carson. Jack Carson never really made it as a top, top star. In fact in most of his movies he played a buffoon or a jerk. But in Rougly Speaking he plays the kind of man most women wish we were married to. It is my opinion that he pretty much played himself. I recommend it: It comes on TCM regularly, if you have not seen it you are in for a real treat. Watch out for Roughly Speaking you will love it.\n",

He was no ordinary fellow , but then again Nicola Tesla was a genius as well and who knows how his childhood was like ? But to return to the movie , Vitus loves life and his parents , even if is hard for him to express that , he is a wunderkind after all, even when he names his educator at kindergarten Obelix he does not do that out of being rude.

            "Spoilers.<br /><br />I rented this one back around Halloween of 1988. I was hoping to be scared, because (as usual), the previews made it look good.<br /><br />So there's this weird dream everyone seems to be having. The words are garbled, so you can't understand it. The footage is grainy. It was made at the height of popularity for the 'shaky camera' videography technique (watch reruns of the first season of NYPD Blue and you'll know what I mean). And they play this clip over and over and over and over and You get the point. It was almost as bad as that '8 more days 'til Halloween' jingle from Halloween 3, Season of the Witch (an even worse movie). But at least there wasn't a song stuck in my head for the next week.<br /><br />If you like lots of bugs, this movie is for you! I personally don't find bugs scary in the least. I think it's a cheap way to freak people out without spending anything for special effects. 'Hey, Larry. Dump another box of roaches in front of the camera!' Yep, bugs galore. But bugs = Satan? That's where you lost me.<br /><br />So then they play that dream clip a few more million times. I know I mentioned this, but I'm trying to take you there on the short tour. Man, this new shaky camera thing is all the rage! Woo hoo!<br /><br />At the end, the girl gets sucked into the mirror with Satan and she's floating underwater in another dimension. You can see his big Satany arm grabbing for her. Then someone smashes the mirror, trapping both of them in there. You then see the look on her face as she realizes just how royally screwed she is. That was the only decent part of the movie.<br /><br />It makes you wonder why they didn't just smash the mirror in the first 5 minutes.\n",

Meryl Streep is the character, while Julia Roberts is simply playing dress-up. I like Roberts in many movies, but not 'Erin Brockovich' which I found very flimsy and pandering. Kind of TV movie of the week. I'm bringing attention to this film because movies get lost very quickly these days, and this is a great one with first rate performances all around, including Cher and Kurt Russell. It works as a small town drama, a character study, and also has elements of suspense. Everything is pulled together neatly and tightly by Mike Nichols here, and the movie, despite the 80's haircuts and style, still gets you going today.\n",

            "A movie with serious and poignant themes that isn't afraid to let out the full force of human emotion and confusion. Brilliant in its ability to draw parallels between the mind of a very \"sick\" individual and our own lives. Various unpleasant modes of motivation are also explored in the screenplay via archetypal imagery and polarity. More than entertainment, the movie is likely to touch a chord in the psyche of even the most jaded part of oneself, encouraging hope for change, while at the same time exploring the inevitable outcome pursuant to the present course as delineated by the characters personas. Let me try saying it this way. Intense themes of alienation, lust, power, anger and confusion are painted with broad and overlapping strokes in this powerhouse of a movie. The canvas of the screen time and again extrudes into the mind of the viewer through imagery, tone, familiarity and by the commentary of a fish. Don't over look the fish. Likely should have gotten a nomination for some screenplay award, and was, well overlooked. And then there is the hummingbird. We aren't really asked to look to deeply at these two pivotal characters in the film, yet they act as a prism regarding the various themes and characters in the film; arguably helping to blend and mix them so we can more easily identify with the film itself. Then there is the use of black and white at the very beginning of the film, one of the rare times I felt that it created more than mood or atmosphere; the footage there was poetic and beautiful. And then the descent into the everyday. Bound to continue to work on the mind, and possibly the psyche, days after viewing. I'd see it again with a friend, or as a film night kind of thing. I think that it would be interesting to listen to what other people thought of it, how they interpreted it, and also to listen to the naysayers of which there likely would be few. It deals with various taboos, and foul motives. Not an upbeat movie, I give it thumbs up.\n",

            "My first true experience with Gundam was through the Wing series when it was shown in the US via Cartoon Network. From then on I watched the 3rd movie of the original, Double Zeta, Char's Counterattack, Victory, and a few episodes of Turn-A. And I appreciated Yoshiyuki Tomino's ability to tell a good war-based story (despite the lighter mood in Double Zeta and Turn-A). And my opinion of him didn't change after I found out that Tomino had psychological problems.<br /><br />I started watching Gundam Seed Destiny with the hopes of seeing a \"Gundam\" title return to its roots. But after episode 21, I lost all hope for anything animated in Japan and having to do with war.<br /><br />Mitsuo Fukuda and Chiaki Morosawa are the two people to blame for this series. How many more \"re-cap episodes,\" rewritten specials, and re-usage of base images must they require in order to be satisfied with their end product? Why make a lead character (who had an actually good story to tell) along with a set of new characters when their next step is to shine the spotlight on the old set of characters? I know the lead singer from TM Revolution had a busy schedule, but why does he have to play some \"shining cannon-fodder\" who lasts less than 5 episodes?<br /><br />I had my opinions of this series booted off of review sites because of my \"bias.\" But isn't it our duty as viewers of media to commit to some \"whistle-blowing\" whenever we see something wrong? If a director, producer, and/or screenwriter rely too much on lazy re-caps, re-usage of images, and \"specials\" based on re-used and re-edited scenes; then one wonders why people like them have been hired or are still employed.\n",

In \"Equalizer 2000\" we have the sexy Corinne Wahl, who handles her guns with proficiency and adds the only spice to the film. The lead is Richard Norton, whose (considerable, if you watch any of his HK work) talents are largely wasted in a few poorly filmed fights, and who is a total blank as a character (more the script's fault than his own). The action scenes are uninteresting and unexciting - chaotic battles between armies of anonymous people whom we don't know or care about. There is just very little worth seeing in this film, and almost all of it comes from Wahl. Even with her, however, your best option is to skip it. (*)\n",

Seriously, Ghost Busters has better special effects in comparison to today's standards which should have made the spook in \"Lucy\" much more believable. And what's with all the open windows - it's late autumn in this movie and bedroom windows are left open just a little to add to the supposed mood with flowing curtains and blowing tree branches.<br /><br />But the big questions is this - what on earth is Julie Delpy (Before Sunset) doing in a movie like this? After the 2004 mini series remake of Frankenstein she should have known better than to sign on for this one! The Legend of Lucy Keyes may very well be just the thing for some movie goers, and good luck to 'em. To each their own.

            "It would be easy to say that this low budget thriller just doesn't work and then point out the obvious flaws but I think it's incredibly sad to watch any actor that is even remotely well known appearing in something so idiotic. Story is about two lesbians that go to their home on Shelter Island to get away from their hectic lives and spend some time alone. Louise Delamere (Ally Sheedy) is a motivational speaker and former pro golfer and while jogging one day is savagely attacked and beaten by an unknown assailant and her girlfriend Alex (Patsy Kensit) is the one that urged her to take time off and heal. <br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />Once they arrive on Shelter Island they run into Sheriff Deluca (Chris Penn) who warns them of an approaching storm. That night during the storm they find an unknown man on their doorstep unconscious and they take him in. He awakens and tells them his name is Lenny (Stephen Baldwin) and he immediately starts to act weird. Once the storm passes they have a difficult time getting rid of him and then to Louise's horror she discovers that Lenny was the one that attacked her before!<br /><br />This film is directed by Geoffrey Schaaf who seems tailored made for those late night Skin-amax flicks that usually star Shannon Tweed but somehow he managed to get some well known actors. This horribly made un-thriller is so bad that it doesn't even work as one of those \"It's so bad it's good\" films and every male character gives new meaning to the word Neanderthal. When Penn is first introduced in the story he starts to meander and mutter about \"being good on the eyes\" and then starts to really babble like an idiot. Baldwin is always irritating no matter what he's in and he's astonishingly primitive here and after talking with Sheedy's character he asks her to arm wrestle! Even though he must outweigh her by 150lbs she beats him and in more than one scene she gets the best of him. Every nude scene with Sheedy and Kensit is with body doubles that look nothing like either one of them so if you had the idea of maybe viewing any of these two naked your out of luck. Sheedy's career had hit a high note in 1998 with the fascinating \"High Art\" and I thought she deserved an Oscar nod for her tough performance but ever since then she has slowly slid back down to crap like this. I can't describe how painfully sad it is to watch a good talented actress like Sheedy having to work in an utter abortion like this. This film fails on every single level and isn't worth anyone's time.\n",

            "Ring 2 <br /><br />Mourning the inexplicable death of her teacher and friend, Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada), Mai Takano (Miki Nakatani) attempts to track down Ryuji's ex-wife, Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima), who has disappeared from Tokyo with her son Yoichi (Rikiya Otaka). The police, who are investigating the death of Reiko's father, are also looking for her, while Okazaki (Yûrei Yanagi), a work colleague of Reiko's, is continuing from her research on an urban legend involving a videotape that kills whoever watches it. Mai and Okazaki's searches lead them both to a mental institute where Masami (Hitomi Sato), who was witness to Sadako's appearance in her best friend Tomoko's house, is being treated by a doctor (Fumiyo Kohinata) who favours some unorthodox medical procedures. Mai eventually manages to track the Asakawas down, but Yoichi is beginning to exhibit some strange behaviour. Can they escape the clutches of Sadako once more? <br /><br />On the exact same day that the insanely successful horror masterwork 'Ring' was released, its sequel, 'The Spiral', seemed to come and go without any fanfare whatsoever. As I haven't viewed a single scene from the original second instalment (written and directed by Jôji Iida), it's impossible for me to say if it was deserving enough of its incredibly poor critical and public reception to be completely erased from the continuity of the series (although some who saw it commented that they would rather have watched Sadako's cursed videotape instead). But, in any case, here we are with the replacement, 'Ring 2', which has caused producer Takashige Ichise to rethink his strategy concerning the next follow-up, and reunited most of the cast and crew from the original 'Ring'. This approach creates mostly pros in 'Ring 2', but also some cons as well.<br /><br />An adaptation of a Kôji Suzuki novel, 'Ring' had a breakneck pace because of its \"race-against-time\" plotting, and 'Ring 2' picks up from this by beginning just days after the events of the first film, allowing the audience to observe the aftermath of the terror that Sadako and her tape wreaked on so many people. But 'Ring 2' isn't based on a book like 'The Spiral' was, and screenwriter Hiroshi Takashi has nothing to build on but the first film. Wisely, Takashi chooses to go off in a new direction with the story instead of merely rehashing what has come before. But 'Ring 2', which hit the ground running, soon slows to a jog. Takashi answers a few too many questions lingering from the first 'Ring', and while he counters this by raising almost as many (especially with the \"weird science\" sections in the final act), one may feel robbed of some of the first film's mystery. However, there's a very interesting subplot involving a schoolgirl named Kanae (played by Kyôko Fukada) who owns a copy of the tape that Okazaki wants to study, and this provides a truly hair-raising sequence, similar to the climax of the first film, where interview footage of a young woman somehow refuses to be erased from the videotape it is on. 'Ring 2' is a nice mix of the best elements of its predecessor and some intriguing new material, but it's also a slightly uneasy one too.<br /><br />With director Hideo Nakata ('Chaos') back on board, it's to be supposed that 'Ring 2' would end up as unsettling as the first film, and the director almost meets this dizzyingly high expectation, but he doesn't want to indulge himself here as much as he did the first time around. Nakata unnecessarily restrains himself on all fronts, with the sound design here being less potent, the cinematography not as innovative, and composer Kenji Kawai's music cues not as chilling as his work on the first film. That said, alongside a thrilling third act, Nakata does offer the audience a host of truly disturbing images, such as a melted, burnt-to-a-crisp videotape in a bathtub, Sadako's reconstructed facial features, and again, the distorted photos of those unlucky enough to have been \"marked\" by Sadako. But, dare I say it, Nakata seems to have become a tiny bit unenthusiastic with 'Ring 2', and this mutes some of the terror that he summoned up so effortlessly in the first film.<br /><br />As in 'The Spiral', pop star Miki Nakatani, who was essentially a cameo in 'Ring' (despite being billed second), is elevated to the lead here. While certainly a competent actress (and has the \"surprised/shocked/scared\" expression nailed), it's difficult to empathise as much with the character of Mai as it is to with Reiko in the first film. Not only due to the step down from Nanako Matsushima's solid performance, but also as events seem to drop into Mai's lap at random. Maybe Nakatani is not to blame; Mai isn't a particularly strong heroine. But, lest I forget, the film is surprisingly as much about the supporting characters as it is about Mai. Especially the denouement, which promises a whole new cycle of horror by leaving the door wide open for another sequel. I can safely say that 'Ring 2' is a creepy, worthy follow up to the first film. But Nakata and co. might like to try a little harder if they decide to make a third (or fourth?) instalment.<br /><br />~ 8/10 ~\n",

            "I translated this film for the Budapest GLBT cultural festival. So I expected something that would show lesbian love in a positive light. Instead, this was a rather depressing feature about a teenage friendship which turned into a love affair \"by chance\". Someone comparing it to Heavenly Creatures had a point. Lesbianism is presented here as an escape from the sordid reality of the girls' (especially Mona's) life.<br /><br />Not that we see much of these lives, though. This was my major problem with the film. It was based on a novel which was clearly autobiographical, and some points got lost on the way. What part did the zealot brother play in the story? And Tamsin's parents? What was the point in the religious procession, and why was it important to include? Where are Mona's parents? A lot of questions that aren't answered. The two actresses are really superb, but they seem to exist in a void, without an even slightly realistic environment. Maybe this is how the author felt at the time of this happening, but it doesn't make a film. At least not a good one.\n",

            "According to the book I read recently, only the last story is really representative of HP Lovecraft work. Let's compare with the selection in that book, a french edition called \"The Colour out of Space\". Briefly, in this edition you find a progressive assimilation of each protagonist in the alien world while reading each different story. \"The drowned\" is all right but not like the awesome \"Dunwich Horror\" and \"The Shadow over Innsmouth\". \"Cold air\" is a good story but with no trace from the Lovecraft's aliens just a kind of Frankenstein. Furthermore, that last story is unrecognizable from the original: the characters are not of the same type with a totally different role (if this could be called a role). The aim of the aliens is not clear. The means to achieve their aim is not logic or clear. All is a pretext to gore and only that ! Finally, I think this film lost it's goal: you cannot make a good film on Lovecraft work with only 3 stories which have no progression or logic between them.\n",

            "This has to be one of the worst ever. Directed by Jason Hrens, it lacked the punch good thrillers give you. First of all the plot, written by Turi Meyer and Al Septien, takes you all over the place, without any sense of where you're going. So it goes around and around. Secondly, it is probably the worst cast ever assembled in one film. One level performances by almost all of the leading players. Angie Everhart, supposedly the temptress, looks old enough to be the hero's mother, even tho she's supposed to be his wicked stepmother. Her acting consists of pursed lips, low cut nightgowns and fussing with her hair. She constantly is playing with her much too long hair. Always brushing it out of her face even thought it continues to fall in her face. Anyone ever hear of bobby pins? She was quite annoying to watch. The hero, played by a poker face Andrew W. Walker, offered nothing but a vacant look on his face and brains of a deadbeat. He was boring to watch. His hot love scenes were toneless and unbelievable. How could anyone be so stupid to fall for the stepmother's obvious put ons. Then there's papa, played by Winston Rehert, who goes around doubting his wife's motives. Is he blind not to see her obvious flirting with his son? Isn't he rich enough to hire a private detective to catch her in the act? Oh, well, some things never occur to jealous husbands, I guess. Amy Sloan as the other woman, was certainly not that attractive to kill for. Please. Get real here. With all the attractive and young starlets, there could have been better choices for this role. Frank Schorpion as the lawyer friend of the family never had his character defined enough to figure just what he had to do with the movie. Although Scorpion was one of the better actors in this trashy film. Bobo Vian as the housekeeper also was good with the little she was offered to do. John Tapor as the Homeless Man should get a mention here for his excellent characterization. He was very believable. Unfortunately he gets two shots in the film and that's it. It seems the better actors are wasted in this chestnut. I give it 3 stars for the three actors I just mentioned. Scorpion, Vian and Tapor. Sorry.\n",

This movie has a cheese factor that could beat out the entire state of Wisconsin. Now don't get me wrong, this movie will hook you with the whole \"plight to save her dead sister's child from the husband who murdered her\" storyline, but that doesn't mean you should sit through it to find out who gets the kid. I happened upon this stereotypical Lifetime movie on a perfectly useful Saturday morning and by the time the film was over, so was the day. It's called a Lifetime movie because it takes a lifetime to watch... For a \"based on a true story\" movie, it was ridiculously unrealistic. The crime scene was so outrageous and the idea that relatives would be allowed to live in the house while it's under police investigation is so unbelievable it's almost laughable.

            "The more I see of this so-called new independent cinema, the more I think \"independent\" simply means an amateur, shot-on-video production which otherwise never would have seen the light of day because the makers obviously lack the talent to succeed in the real movie business. Case in point, The Vicious Sweet, a very pedestrian offering which only proves that some people weren't meant to work on either side of a camera. Instead of any legitimate acting, we get a lot of self-important posturing while dialogue is delivered so forcibly that you can see the lines leap right off the script pages. The camera work is obviously rock video influenced, something which unfortunately passes for mise-en-scène these days, while the gore effects are used strictly for shock value in place of any real scares. Whereas shot-on-video productions such as The Blair Witch Project and The Last Broadcast succeeded because of their innovative approach to the format, this film, or should I say video, makes it abundantly clear that affordable public access to video technology isn't necessarily a good thing.\n",

            "An old house, which has a terrible story behind it. Is taken over by an elderly couple, and the spirit of a murdered girl possesses the mistress's young companion from time to time. But it takes awhile for the occupants of the house to pick up on it, as they think that the strange happenings are caused by their staff and don't think too much of it. That's until they learn more about the tragic history of the house and come to accept that they share the estate with a depressed spirit.<br /><br />RKO studios turn out a nicely made ghost story, which holds a certain amount of charm, and on show is a beautifully elegant production. Although saying that, it not terribly thick in depth. A lot of things are totally glazed over, with certain plot details being pushed aside or briskly concluded. Meaning it does lack tension in parts and the mystery of the house does get rather bogged down to be totally effective. It leans more towards drama/mystery and adds a romance story, than really showing anything horrifying or drumming up suspense. Although there's one scene that stands out from the rest towards the end it's a neat twist to end it off with. But nonetheless it's a family drama with light touches of horror, where the awkward love sub-plot seems to make the ghost story play second fiddle to it. Which is too bad, as there's a mystery around every turn with the strange occurrences building up slowly from our mysterious ghost. I just wished it shared a bit more focus on it.<br /><br />Overall, it's a polished effort with the house being the centrepiece, (sometimes you could easily tell it was small model) and the disquieting nature of the building fills the atmosphere. There's no real score other than for the thriving one in the intro and ending credits. Well, you got one of your characters playing the piano in the film. But I thought it benefited from not having one run throughout the film. The photography was rather outstanding, especially the moving angles throughout the house.<br /><br />Bernard Knowles directs a simple, but yet slightly engrossing picture that has a solid plot (if rather slow going), with a tight script and exceptional performances from the likes of James Mason and Barbara Mullen.\n",

            "In reviewing African-Americans on film in chronological order for Black History Month, we're now at 1936 with the first all-black production for a major studio since Hallelujah! from MGM in 1929: The Green Pastures from Warner Bros. Rex Ingram stars in three roles-De Lawd, Adam, and Hezdrel. As De Lawd, Ingram brings a human dimension to the Supreme Being that expresses his doubts occasionally because of the way things turn out. Playwright Marc Connelly brought to his screenplay adaptation some wonderful humorous touches in retelling some of the bible stories like that exchange between De Lawd and Noah (Eddie Anderson who I just saw at the beginning of Show Boat) about whether to bring one keg or two of whiskey to the ark or Gabriel (Oscar Polk) saying he'll spit in the eye of Satan! Among the females, Edna Mae Harris makes an impression in her brief role of Zeba who, after her boyfriend gets shot, takes a shine to the one who shot him! Was most impressed with the Moses story especially the trick scene with the walking stick turning into a snake and what happened afterward when the Pharaoh initially refused Moses' request to let his people go. The spiritual singing of the Hall Johnson Choir serving as score throughout was very inspirational. And having New Orleans being mentioned as the Sin City told this Louisianian how some things never change! While, yes, there's some stereotypes about the Negroes being such simple people (with heaven presented as a fish fry and the angels getting ten-cent cigars), there's also a message about tolerance and how, despite all that's wrong with the world, there's also plenty that's right that is made clear at the end when there's word of someone being nailed at the cross...\n",

            "How many viewers of \"I Capture the Castle\" have a legal background and understand the humor underlying the family name of the central characters, \"Mortmain?\" Literally, \"mortmain\" means \"Dead Hand\" and in law it denotes the attempt of a person to control his property postmortem. The humor here is that the paterfamilias, James Mortmain (well played by Bill Nighy) is a dried up author who hasn't penned a word since a successful novel of twelve years past. He claims to be working on a new book, an assertion that may be face-saving but is of dubious credibility. James has a past that the family neither wishes to remember nor can face seeing its reappearance (can't reveal what that is, can I?).<br /><br />When still at the top of his game Mortmain and his then wife (who later dies, no foul play here) and his two little girls stumbled upon a rodent infested castle which he leased.<br /><br />Jump quite a bit ahead to a now remarried Mortmain who lives in the still unrestored castle with his new, young, artist wife, Topaz (the beautiful, funny and accomplished Tara Fitzgerald) and his two teenage daughters, an appropriately mischievous little son and a sort of retainer in farm clothes, young Stephen.<br /><br />The family is now, as the English say, \"on their uppers.\"<br /><br />Rose (Rose Byrne) is a gorgeous redhead solely obsessed with marrying out of the castle into the squirearchy or at least the solvent. Younger sister Cassandra (Ronola Garai) is engagingly wise, funny and bewildered at the changes that overtake her family when two young Americans succeed to the ownership of a manor that encompasses the castle (for which rent is long overdue). The sisters' close, interdependent relationship is warmly portrayed.<br /><br />So Rose pursues one of the Americans, Cassandra deals with first love, spurning one suitor while secretly pining for another. An interweaved subplot has Topaz and then Cassandra desperately acting as James's muse, seeking to ignite what may well be the drenched sparks of a one-novel author.<br /><br />As would be expected of a drama set in England in the 1930s before the hideousness of war returned are the inevitable class clashes, both economic and trans-Atlantic. What would a film like this be without a formal dining room scene replete with persiflage and the ominous threat of words said that can not be retracted?<br /><br />\"I Capture the Castle\" has a strong cast but Cassandra is the centerpiece as she shows developing resolve and growth. Her appeal is irresistible. She's the younger sister many have fantasized but few have had. Ms. Garai is marvelously believable.<br /><br />Yes, the film is in the Merchant/Ivory and Masterpiece Theatre vein but what's wrong with that?

'Hitch' is everything this movie is not. It is funny, fast paced, with great chemistry between actors, and a good leading male in Will Smith. 'Guess Who' however was incredibly predictable and slow moving at times. While there were a lot of \"funny\" parts in the movie, there was nothing in it that I laughed out loud at. The jokes were forced out for the most part, and the actors looked like they were going through the motions. There didn't seem to be much chemistry between the the leading male and female in this. At no point did I feel I was looking at real characters. I just felt I was seeing Bernie Mac playing the role of the father, and Ashton playing the 'boyfriend'. Ashton was silly while trying to be funny, which is his style and personality. But he was unconvincing and awkward while trying to be serious. Ashton is just in over his head with this kind of acting. He was in his element with the show 'Punked', and 'Dude Where's my Car?'.<br /><br />In short, this is one I would suggest waiting to see on video. If you were thinking of a good evening out, I would suggest Hitch or go with a totally different genre of movie.\n",

Though it has to be said, when Compo died, so did the show. <br /><br />Set in Holmfirth (ten mins away from my home) a West Yorkshire village, the show started in 1973, and it was about three old men Compo Simonite (Bill Owen), Norman Clegg (Peter Sallis) and Cyril Blamire (Michael Bates). Compo being scruffy, Clegg being \"NORMAL!\" and Cyril being appalled by Compo's untidiness. These old men get up to the most strangest of adventures, Compo being sexually obsessed with next door neighbour Nora Batty (Kathy Staff). The trio often went to the café in most episodes, owned by Sid (John Comer) and awful wife Ivy (Jane Freeman). When Michael Bates died, the role of the \"third man\" went to ex military man Foggy Dewhurst (Brian Wilde). Wilde played the role for ten years, then he left, so next \"third man\", Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), a mad inventor. Aldridge then left the series, so in 1990, Foggy Dewhurst returned. Wilde played the part until 1997, when he picked up an ailment, so he was forced to retire. This looked like the end of the show, but no. Who was to be the next \"third man\". Michael Aldridge had died in 1995, so he couldn't take over. It went to ex Policeman Herbert Truelove (Frank Thornton). This went on until Bill Owen died in 1999. That really should have been the end of the show, but the great Roy Clarke (Open All Hours, Keeping up Appearances) made a bad decision, to carry the show on. You can't have Last of the Summer Wine without Compo. Without Compo it's just \"Last of the......\".<br /><br />Who is my favourite third man. Cyril was excellent, Seymour and Herbert were good, but it has to go to Foggy. The episodes with Brian Wilde in were great.<br /><br />Best Episode: It is one of the two part episodes \"The Great Boarding House Bathroom Caper\" and \"Cheering up Gordon\", which is about when Compo, Clegg, Foggy, Sid, Ivy and Gordon(Compo's nephew) go on holiday to Scarbourgh, only to find Nora Batty and husband Wally are staying in the same boarding house.\n",

            "Like a lot of prepubescent children in 1989 or 1990, my imagination was captured by this new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fad. I remember sitting down and watching an interview with the creators, a pair of comic book authors who chose to go the independent route and gamble on their own ability to succeed. They were lucky enough to win against the odds, at least for a time, but in this interview, they also mentioned something about believing the phenomenon would go on forever. Well, the Turtles are still selling on comic book stands, and you can still see some of their adventures on DVD, but as to whether it survived the 1990s is a matter of opinion.<br /><br />The first feature film, complete with man-sized turtles played by actors in suits, was a low-budget triumph. Indeed, the dominance of Golden Harvest studios in Hong Kong martial arts cinema can easily be traced back to their winning of the rights to do the original film. With a little help from the Jim Henson workshop and some well-cast B-actors in key support roles, the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film was a major success that utterly dumbfounded the studio system. What is even more surprising is how the film did not go in the easy \"we're primarily marketing to children, so we can be patronising\" route that most children's entertainment follows.<br /><br />That last point is where the first sequel, and this one in particular, went wrong. By the time 1993 rolled around, the Turtles fad had more or less utterly died, replaced by a far longer-lasting fascination with The Simpsons. As a direct result, the budget allocated by Golden Harvest to the third Turtles film was a mere fraction of that allotted to the first film. This is most obvious in the turtles themselves. Sure, they are still portrayed by men in suits, and those suits are still maintained by the Henson workshop, but the overall tone of the turtles' skin and the motion of their mouths indicates that Golden Harvest told the Henson workshop that they just wanted something passable. Given that the first film was dedicated to Jim because it was one of the last things he worked on before he died, this is quite the sad come-down.<br /><br />Another major problem is in the tone of the story. While the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will never be confused with the likes of RoboCop, the first film went back to the roots of the original comic book and depicted a world that was, for all intents, rather dark. There was a bare hint that being a 5'6\" turtle with consciousness was not all it was cracked up to be, unlike the utopia implied by the afternoon cartoon series. There was acrimony, grief, rage, and a million other things that children's entertainment seems to believe we cannot really handle now or ever. That was what turned Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles into Golden Harvest's big breakaway hit.<br /><br />Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, also known as Turtles In Time, picks up with the turtles milling around their sewer hideout with Splinter (who now looks like a shag carpet with eyes). When April shows up with a bunch of items she found at a garage sale, she happens upon an ancient artifact that transports her back in time to feudal Japan. The turtles, in their usual confused weird-species adolescent fervour, take it upon themselves to go back and rescue her, because we all know how an adolescent turtle would go all bug-eyed at the thought of rescuing a woman who looks anything like Paige Turco.<br /><br />Elias Koteas, the real star of the original film, gets to jump back in here, but the character he is best known for spends most of his time eating pizza, watching over a bunch of Japanese soldiers who changed places in time with the turtles (don't ask), and sharing conversation with the shag carpet that Splinter turned into. For the rest of the time, he plays one of the English scoundrels who are trading with the Japanese monarchs. Yeah, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Nor does it particularly excite the viewer. In fact, much like the previous film, the fight sequences are so toned-down and PG-fied that the adults in the audience will fall asleep. Or worse yet, just use this film as a kind of artificial babysitter, which I somehow doubt was what Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird had in mind for their original creations. I don't doubt that they were trying to reach the widest possible audience, but as this film proves, the more you try to please everyone, the more you wind up pleasing no one.<br /><br />I gave Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III a one out of ten. There are moments when it gets bad enough to be funny. The problem is that there are just not enough such moments to justify this film for all but the most hardcore fans of the turtles. And since the most serious fans would all be at least twenty years old by now, well, let us just say this film has its work cut out for it pleasing even that audience.\n",

Even though it's old and creaky, even though it's mannered and any violence happens discretely off-camera, THE BLACK CAT somehow has the power to make me feel uneasy.<br /><br />Even though it has some weird stuff happening, like Lugosi telling his loyal servant to obey Karloff (does he REALLY switch sides, or is he only pretending as Lugosi told him too?) and Lugosi not just shooting Karloff when he has the chance, the creepiest thing in the whole movie is that after marrying Lugosi's wife, Karloff now sleeps with his step-daughter. Now THAT is messed up!<br /><br />Other highlights are the skin-flaying scene (really nasty) and the oddball black mass (where did all those people come from and how did they get to the mansion when the innocent young couple found it impossible to leave?)<br /><br />THE BLACK CAT is an odd and uneasy treat and if you enjoy it based on this recommendation, try BLACK Friday which can be found in the same Lugosi box set.\n",

            "\"The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button\" would seem to have everything going for it - major stars, an enormous budget, and a conceit that can't be beat. However, in the end it's that very conceit that hamstrings an otherwise wondrous piece of movie-making.<br /><br />Fincher's characters tend to be psychos, paranoiacs, obsessives, some of whom struggle vainly against the darkness in their own souls, but many others who have embraced it. Benjamin Button is none of the above, and that's perhaps his problem. Button, born \"under unusual circumstances\" in 1918 New Orleans, spends his early life literally surrounded by death, raised, as he is, by an orderly in a home for the elderly. As a prematurely old man himself (an effect achieved by fantastic MOCAP work from Pitt), perhaps it's not surprising that as he grows into a body with which he may truly engage the world, he is more content to observe appreciably. <br /><br />Now, this may be true to the spirit of the character, but unfortunately for Fincher and his screenwriter, Eric Roth, it doesn't make for very interesting cinema. At a recent screening, Roth referred to Button's character as the \"anti-Gump\", a classification that seemed both apt and problematic. This film will certainly earn comparisons to Robert Zemeckis' modern classic(also written by Roth), but where that film had a truly fascinating central character, who experienced as many mistakes and tragedies as victories and happiness, Fincher and Roth's protagonist is a cipher. There's a telling sequence around the middle of the film, where Button, by now a merchant seaman holed up in a dingy hotel in Murmansk, strikes up a relationship with a bored wife of a minor British official (Tilda Swinton). Unable to sleep, they meet each night for tea and good conversation (and later, sex). But instead of letting us hear what those conversations are about, he simply creates a montage, set to music, of various meetings fading into one another. By the time Swinton's character departs the film, we know next to nothing new about Benjamin other than that he has trouble sleeping and likes hot tea. The fact is that even Swinton's character, on screen for perhaps fifteen minutes, is more engaging. It's a frustrating glimpse of what might have been, had the filmmakers chosen to put the character before the gimmick, instead of the other way around.<br /><br />Which brings us to Cate Blanchett. As Daisy, whom Benjamin meets as a young girl and who grows into a luminously beautiful and troubled ballet dancer, Blanchett shines as brightly as she ever has on screen. Unlike Benjamin, Daisy is not content to simply accept whatever life throws her way - she has dreams and attempts to act on them, and does her best to lead a normal, interesting life. Benjamin, passive as always, must quietly observe as she grows out of the playmate of his \"youth\" and into a somewhat headstrong woman who nonetheless possessed of enormous potential. His loyalty pays off, though, when circumstances bring them together again at a time when they both happen to be the same age - a fleeting moment, and one they will cherish. But again, the relationship between couple and audience is one-sided, because while we can see why Daisy would wish to return to the rock-steady loyalty of Benjamin, it's unclear what he feels about her other than a regard (she's certainly lovely enough). We are told in rather soggy voice-over narration (spread throughout the film) that Daisy is \"the most beautiful person I'd ever seen\", but that's all we'll get. <br /><br />And so it goes, for nearly three hours. We cut frequently, and irritatingly, back to a modern-day hospital in New Orleans, where a dying Daisy asks her daughter (Julia Ormond) to read to her from Benjamin's diary as Hurricane Katrina pounds on the windows. There's something being said in these scenes about regret and the passage of time, but the appealing Ormond's character is one-note, and Blanchett seems nearly suffocated under pounds of old age makeup. It's from this diary whence springs Benjamin's narration, but, as Mr. Roth pointed out, Gump this ain't. Suffice it to say that the budget is up there on screen as we go on this strange trip through the twentieth century with Brad Pitt as our guide. A possibly unintentional (I doubt it) laugh arises mid-film when Benjamin finally reaches something around Pitt's own age. He strides into a garage in the mid-50's, decked out in leather jacket and shades, and whips a tarp off a motorcycle, on which he speeds out to the harbor to do some bare-chested sailing on a boat he builds himself (the shades remain on his head). It's a knowing wink to the wish-fulfillment of the casting - who wouldn't want their old crotchety husband to get younger and younger until they looked like Brad Pitt? - and a clever way to underscore the underlying tragedy of the situation. Sure, he looks like Brad Pitt in \"Fight Club\", \"Se7en\", \"Thelma & Louise\", but eventually he's going to look like Brad Pitt in \"Cutting Class\", and then Brad Pitt in seventh grade, and finally Brad Pitt as a toddler, and that's not so sexy.<br /><br />Pitt does a fine job. It's a pity that Fincher, who has used him to such great effect twice before, didn't let him cut loose. Instead this is his most low-key performance since Meet Joe Black, in which he played Death, who was really just a nice young man curious about the world. Come to think of it, that's pretty much all that Benjamin Button is, and, if nothing else, he knows more about death than just about anybody around. Too bad that a film that means to affirm life turns out to be rather lifeless.\n",

            "I promised myself I wouldn't compare my first viewing of \"Lady Snowblood\" too much with Quentin Tarantino's widely acclaimed masterpiece \"Kill Bill\", but the truth is you simply CAN'T think about anything else as I didn't expect the two films to be this similar. After seeing \"Lady Snowblood\", I now have endless respect for Toshiya Fujita's spectacular exploitation classic and actually a little less admiration for QT, since he blindly copied the entire concept of this film and even took over the ingenious narrative structure. The plot outline of \"Lady Snowblood\" is incredibly simple, but the film is brought to a much higher quality-level due to the marvelous & stylish subdivision of the story into four chapters. Hence, the basic given of a young woman who dedicates her whole life to take revenge on the criminals who sadistically killed her parents suddenly becomes a hugely compelling and elegant mini-saga that'll keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The first chapter enlightens us about what happened to Yuki's parents and how she was born to complete the vengeance mission her mother started. Twenty years and an endless series of devastating fighting lessons later, she's ready to violently slay the three remaining bastards that ruined her life before it even started. Every confrontation with one of them marks a new chapter, resulting in an outrageous climax inside a restaurant (also clearly imitated by Tarantino). What an amazingly sensational film experience this is! The sword-fighting sequences are insanely grotesque  with the victims' blood squirting from here to Tokyo  but at the same time, the tone of the film constantly remains melodramatic and even a tad bit poetic. It's very difficult to blend extreme violence with a serious atmosphere, but Toshiya Fujita seemly pulls it off without too much effort. The set pieces and camera-work are sublime, suggesting very profitable production values for such a typical Japanese exploitation flick from the 70's, and the music (againcopied in \"Kill Bill\") epitomizes the genius of this unique film even more. Meiko Kaji portrays the titular character splendidly, with honest emotions and a convincing charisma. This great actress also starred in the equally notorious exploitation franchise \"Female Scorpion\". I reckon it's a great honor to serve as the principal influence for a Quentin Tarantino film, but \"Lady Snowblood\" deserves to be even bigger than \"Kill Bill\" itself. It's a masterpiece!\n",

The acting is wooden beyond belief, but then - there is a very little for the actors (well, I call them actors ...) to work on. The dialogue is silly: when a conspirator tries to suck up to Sheba, he says \"You and I have much more in common than you may realise; you are very beautiful\". The plot is absurd, too. We get two royals riding huge distances in the desert (she is not even wearing a hat), with about half a dozen attendants each. Realistic or what? Sheba even gets to lead her own horse to water when they reach an oasis: I suppose the budget didn't stretch to servants and other such inessential items. Or maybe the research department fell down on the job. Be that as it may, I spilled my coffee laughing. But I can't pretend I tried to follow the storyline, as I kept missing bits when they spoke too softly while I was laughing.

It is a \"Citizen Kane\"-styled story of a female film student who tries to trace the history of Birkut, a long-forgotten \"hero\" of the Polish Communist government.<br /><br />She begins by viewing propaganda film that praises Birkut as a devout worker who slaves away at brick-laying for the officials. He has the appearance of a vigilant, Hercules-like strongman who breezes through the labor without breaking a sweat. Then she goes to interview the director, who was hired by the government. He tells her about the reality of making the film, such as how Birkut was given extra food and water (unlike the other bricklayers). Wajda uses these two conflicting scenes to deconstruct the false imagery that propaganda gives its viewers. He shows us how officials manipulate such situations to their own political good.<br /><br />The student goes on to interview other subjects who describe the brutal reality of Birkut's off-camera existence. In one devastating scene, she meets his wife, who breaks down and tries to avoid being interviewed. As the truth becomes clearer and clearer, the government begins to intercede in the production of the student's film.<br /><br />Wajda was a film-maker who was not afraid to criticize the harsh Polish government that eventually was defeated by individuals such as Lech Walesa. MAN OF MARBLE is a testament to those who had to live through the oppression of Communism, and also to those who are still living under its iron fist.\n",

This one doesn't have the sustained thematic focus of the first, but all in all it's as twisted, watchable, and occasionally amusing as fans of the series would hope. If Emily Perkins's performance doesn't blow us away as it did in `Ginger Snaps,' that's only because it's not as much of a surprise this time around, and Tatiana Maslany's Ghost makes a goofy but plausible addition to the films' world. As I said, it's not the out-and-out allegory that the first film was, but there are rich satiric moments, flashes of wit (Brigitte's discovery of her hairy palms comes to mind), and nice nods to werewolf-movie convention, with the finale taking place in a remote cabin in the snowy woods. There are a few problems too--a weak, TV-ish performance by Eric Johnson, completely unnecessary cameos by Ginger herself, and worst of all an unfair and somewhat sad shift of focus at the end. But these things don't really diminish `Ginger Snaps 2's' accomplishments, and it remains an entertaining and original new horror film--a very rare thing these days. 7.5 out of 10.\n",

            "A few years ago I saw a movie called Madhouse that was pretty good. Not as good as another similar one called Session 9, but still a fairly entertaining horror thriller about a mental institution. I expected something of the same with The Sickhouse, but I suppose it is meant to describe an orphanage from the late 17th Century that had been infected with the Bubonic Plague. We get a brief history lesson at the beginning of the movie about how the Plague swept through London in 1665, killing 15% of the city's population in a single summer. An American archaeologist thinks she has uncovered an ancient black cult involving priests and the plague victims, but she is brushed off by a British colleague, who is indifferent to her interest despite frightening revelatory evidence that she has uncovered. Public health, she says, sometimes has to be put before archaeology.<br /><br />Enter a car full of British punks, screaming through the streets in a stolen car and filming themselves using a stolen video camera. Before long, midnight strikes, they run over someone or something in the street and come skidding to a stop, and we cut back to Anna, the American archaeologist, who has somehow stumbled upon a buried 17th Century street.<br /><br />This is where I got lost, and I stayed lost for pretty much the rest of the movie. We see clocks striking midnight a lot, so clearly something happens at midnight, but it's never really very clear what it is. And what is the deal with the buried street? I guess the Plague was so traumatic that that just paved over the old streets and built modern London on top of it? I have no idea. <br /><br />Anna is a huge problem in the movie. She claims to have this huge historical knowledge (and also does that intolerable thing late in the movie where everyone is fearful for their lives and she is frantically giving history lessons), but is astonishingly clueless about how to handle the Plague. At one point, one of the characters is supposedly infected with the plague, so they put him in a wire cage and then Anna suggests that they all go wash their hands.<br /><br />Wow, all those primitive Londoners had to do was wash their hands! Think of all the lives that could have been saved!<br /><br />The movie soon leaves any story behind and descends into a shabby special effects display that reminded me of old Nightmare on Elm Street movies. And if the special effects weren't bad enough, they also throw in the \"I don't think any of this is real\" thing, so none of it matters anyway. <br /><br />The story, rather than having much of anything to do with a mental institution OR the plague, is about an orphanage in which a series of terrible thing happened to five of the orphans. Surprise, there are five characters in the movie and, as Anna explains, history \"seems to be repeating itself.\"<br /><br />No reason is given but none is needed. This is standard, 9th grade creative writing. Now we have the catalyst that introduces \"death's design\" which was kicked to death with three Final Destinations and provides a weak drive for the rest of the movie. <br /><br />There is a romantic moment at the very end of the film that is spectacularly out of place and dissolves immediately any character development that might have come before, and like much of the rest of the movie, it ends with a small child whispering some utter nonsense to us. We are told that the plague doctor will live on forever, \"and you being a malignant host, an infant herald of doom.\"<br /><br />What?!?<br /><br />Well, let me give you a little chronology. The Sixth Sense - 9-year-old boy sees dead people. Ghost Town - annoyed British dentist sees dead people. The Sickhouse - American archaeologist sees dead British people. That would be really interesting if the movies were released in that order...\n",

The late Ángel Tavira is excellent as the grandfather -- the human face of an underground resistance -- whose weapon of choice is a violin. The long shots, in black-and-white, of Tavira on his borrowed mule reminded me of the scene in The Grapes of Wrath where Tom Joad leads his family of Dust Bowl émigrés across the ridge of a California hill or the panoramic shots of Sicilian hillsides in Godfather II.

But it is a fun film that will amuse adults and make kids laugh and shriek with delight.<br /><br />Tim Conway and Don Knotts play a couple of bumbling (what else?) Scotland Yard detectives assigned to investigate a murder at a castle in England (actually North Carolina). While in the castle they stumble across loads of creepy characters and situations.<br /><br />For anyone who has enjoyed this type of film (\"Hold That Ghost\" with Abbott and Costello, and \"The Ghost and Mr. Chicken\" come to mind), \"The Private Eyes\" delivers the goods. Of course if you sit there and try to analyze it too deeply you are apt to dislike it. Just sit back with the family and have a good laugh.\n",

            "There are some good parts to this movie but overall it is very boring and slow. It's a somewhat interesting story about life in a very small west Texas town. 4 graduating Seniors, over half the senior class, are coming to terms of whether or not they want to keep their boyhood pledge of leaving once they graduate. It's main quality is the \"Human Element\". Some of the writing acting and directing is done quite well but overall the movie just lacks something. If you like movies about people you will like it but it's a bit slow for the Rambo and/or Chris Tucker crowd.<br /><br />The scenery is quite nice, horses, mountains, desert vistas and Oak Trees. The background characters and props are done well and not overdrawn. The cinematography is excellent and the direction is quite good if you like a minimalist approach.\n",

            "I have always had a secret pantheon of actresses (like all movie lovers do) who I could watch most of the time quite happily. In the so-called \"Golden Age\" of talking films the two twin lights were Bette Davis and Kate Hepburn. I never have really chosen which of the two was the greater. The number of Oscars they won, totaling six - two for Davis and four for Hepburn - meant nothing because Hepburn won one for MORNING GLORY, which is now a historical curiosity, and one for GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, which she knew was a joint one for herself and Spencer Tracy, while Davis' first Oscar was not for Joyce Heath in the badly written DANGEROUS. So the Oscars they won are not really great measuring devices.<br /><br />Anyone else on that top line - well, I suppose that everyone can fill in some name (Crawford, Russell, Lombard, Garbo, take your pick). To me the third one would have been their only real peer as an actress who could play anything: Barbara Stanwyck. She never got a specific Oscar, although she did get nominated for her best recalled role of the villain Phyllis in DOUBLE INDEMNITY (still the champion icy killer of that period). Towards the end of her career (like Davis and Hepburn she worked up to the end, in her case mostly on television), she got an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement. Somehow, given her abilities as sex object (BABY FACE), tragic mother (STELLA DALLAS), killer (DOUBLE INDEMNITY), comedienne par excellence (THE LADY EVE, BALL OF FIRE), even willing to sing in a musical number (LADY IN BURLESQUE - imagine Hepburn trying to sing in a film!), a lifetime award seemed actually more fitting than any particular film choice by the Academy.<br /><br />Having said that, I must admit one giant reservation for Stanwyck. While Davis was frequently characterized as appearing only in \"woman's movies\" (then how explain THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER or WATCH ON THE RHINE?) and while Hepburn seemed to be too much the social snob (even in PAT AND MIKE or DESK SET?) they never got as seriously type-cast as Stanwyck did after her best known villain role. Phyllis Dietrichsen is a fascinating bitch - no other way to explain her evil spell on people. She destroys or threatens anybody who is in her way to wealth, using her sexuality as the ultimate weapon. Possibly the sexiest unseen moment in film noir is that brief time off screen between her and Fred MacMurray in his apartment, beginning with them kissing, and ending with her fixing her face with her compact and lipstick. You know they were screwing at that point.<br /><br />But after that film's success the three stars had different trajectories. MacMurray did an occasional heel again (THE CAINE MUTINY, THE APARTMENT), but was mostly playing good guys. Eddie Robinson played all sorts of characters in all kinds of films, but never another insurance expert. But it is like Stanwyck found herself playing variants of Phyllis every four or five pictures. Not in all her film noir (in the TWO MISS CAROLLS she is threatened by insane husband/killer Humphrey Bogart) but look at some of the other films: THE STRANGE LOVE OF MARTHA IVERS, THE FURIES, THE FILE ON THELMA JORDAN. Her great intensity was constantly used to make her the most lethal of the three greatest actress (Davis comes next with THE LETTER and THE LITTLE FOXES, but with a bland iciness that rarely breaks until the end).<br /><br />CRIME OF PASSION is nowhere near as good as DOUBLE INDEMNITY or THE FURIES or even THE STRANGE LOVE OF MARTHA IVERS. In fact it has some of the worst writing in a film noir I have come across. Film noir plots at their best are logical outcroppings of humanity and twists of fate (Neff selling insurance to a greedy monster; Robinson spending a pleasant evening with Joan Bennett when they are forced to kill her jealous, insane lover in THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW). Here it comes down to this - do not marry a woman who is insanely into your job status! That's the plot.<br /><br />Stanwyck works on a newspaper, and she has been contacted by a killer. She dislikes Detective Royal Dano, who belittled her with a sexist remark (actually one of the small, rare, realistic pluses in this 1957 film), and uses her tip to help handsome, nice Sterling Hayden. Hayden and she hit it off, and marry. But she is appalled that he is unwilling to push for promotions she thinks he deserves (at one point later on, Raymond Burr will make the point that Hayden really did not merit the promotions - and pays for saying so). Stanwyck (like Dennis Price in a far better film) starts seeing how to remove competition for her husband, and ends up romancing Burr (married to Fay Wray). But when that fails to change things, she kills Burr - and suddenly Hayden is temporarily promoted. So it can work for awhile.<br /><br />The dialog is awful. If she were arguing with Hayden about killing someone for a fortune maybe it would work. But she is arguing with a character reminiscent of the young David Morse on ST. ELSEWHERE in terms of \"live and let live\" philosophy. This might have been better as a comedy in which the lack of push by Hayden leads Stanwyck into finally divorcing her husband (much to his relief). Instead it leads to Hayden belatedly realizing the nut he married. The best character in it is Burr, who when seeing the results of his tawdry affair comes to his senses and resolves to end it and return to Wray, the woman he always loved. One wishes that had been built up a bit. CRIME OF PASSION is only worth seeing if one wants to see all of Stanwyck's films. But be prepared to be disappointed.\n",

            "This is not the video nastie, but only because it came out in 1994 when they were presumably tired of the whole thing in Britain. It is 75% a rehash of The Boogeyman, and would have been banned for the same reason - whatever that was.<br /><br />I was initially confused as I thought that Annie (Kelly Galindo) may have been a different Lacey, but she was someone trouble by psychic visions of a boogeyman similar to the one in the first film. Fans will immediately note that they are not the same person.<br /><br />After seeing a murder in a bathroom, and also seeing the address as well, Annie, her psychiatrist and a para psychology student who greatly resembles the guy on the cheap romance novels and butter commercials, head to the house, and, sure enough, it's the same bathroom. 24 hours later a murder happens just as she described. Of course, we have no idea who this boobilicious woman is or why she was murdered.<br /><br />Then the movie shift to a rerunning of The Boogeyman story with some extra footage that we did not see in the original. Notably, the boogeyman is shown unlike the original. Sadly, some of the good scenes were cut, but 90% of it is there. Why rerun this film? Did they find the footage in the trash? What was the purpose? <br /><br />We'll never know and, despite the psychologist telling Annie she is cured, we all know the bogeyman will never die.\n",

            "This is a truly wonderful and imaginative cartoon. The animation is very effective and beautiful if rather simple. The music is a real highlight, I love the cartoons that feature classical music, and this is no exception. Franz Lizst's \"Hungarian Rhapsody no 2\" (amongst others) is a real treat, but extremely complicated to play on the piano and put to really clever use. Bugs is not as funny as he usually is, but he does a stellar job, courtesy to some brilliant vocal characterisations from Mel Blanc. During his performance of \"Hungarian Rhapsody no 2\", Bugs has to overcome many obstacles, such as the coughing audience member and being upstaged by a musical (and cute) mouse in a Tom and Jerry-like scenario. The minimal use of dialogue is good, the funniest gag of the cartoon was the telephone call where Bugs says \"Franz Lizst? Nah, never heard of him!\" Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this, it mayn't be Bug's very best but it is great fun. 10/10 Bethany Cox\n",

            "The creature is not a large one. At first glance, it doesn't even seem to be anything more than an ordinary dog.<br /><br />But then you look closer. The wolf's mouth is larger than that of an ordinary dog, the teeth packed more densely together within. The wolf's eyes gleam a sickly yellow colour, and a vicious snarl augments the drool flowing from its mouth.<br /><br />The creature leaps at you with supernatural speed and strength. Its front paws knock you flat on your back, and you feel the freezing earth soaking through your shirt, the full moon gleaming down like a cruel eye, watching you.<br /><br />The wolf doesn't bother with a killing wound; it just begins to tear chunks of flesh from your stomach, ignoring your agonized screams. It will be a long, long time before your body loses all feeling, and everything goes dark.<br /><br />Manuel Romasanta was a traveling merchant and salesman in the mid eighteen hundreds, who, at some point, went completely and utterly insane. He believed himself to be a werewolf, a man who would assume the form of an unnaturally large and brutal wolf whenever the moon was full. Manifesting from this belief was the need to kill, and so kill he did, some sixteen or more people, chosen completely at random, no discrimination. He would slaughter them, devour them and then leave the bodies for others to find.<br /><br />There have been so many movies made that have been based on the lives of serial killers- Jack the Ripper, Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy, etc. It seemed a mere matter of time until they dredged up this psychopath from the history books and immortalized him through film. <br /><br />But, of course, being set in the time that it is, and under the circumstances through which the events surrounding the case unfolded, they couldn't have been content merely to make a slasher/thriller sort of thing documenting the life of a serial killer. No, they had to turn it into a werewolf movie.<br /><br />And what a fantastic werewolf movie it turned out to be. I was expecting the sorts of cheesy werewolf effects that we saw in such movies as \"Dog Soldiers\" and \"Underworld\" (although to tell you the truth, I enjoyed both of those movies, solely for the action content in them). But groundless were all my fears, for as the movie progresses it becomes increasingly clear that this is not your usual, run-of-the-mill type of werewolf crap, with Romasanta assuming the form of a proper wolf when he transforms. Rather than \"Dog Soldiers\", it portrays itself more as being along the lines of \"Ginger Snaps\", with much the same sort of tragic tale at the heart of it.<br /><br />As with seemingly all new-age horror movies, even those done in an older sort of style (such as this one), there is a love story at the heart of the movie. However, true to the bizarre nature of this movie, it is not a happy tale of love that unfolds, rather a twisted tragedy in which neither side comes off any better than the other. For those of you who possess something like a twisted romanticism, I tell you now not to miss this one, you'll regret it if you do.<br /><br />I've already told you basically all you need to know about the story of this movie, and I'm not going to ruin all the twists and turns of the movie so as to spoil your viewing enjoyment. Just be sure not to miss this one, especially if you liked \"Ginger Snaps\".\n",

In fact, the car goes from damaged to not damaged to damaged. I don't know why they bothered to film this in Bucharest unless it is super cheap to do so. They showed us almost nothing of the place.

            "This screen adaptation of the John Steinbeck classic novel is a harsh, fantastic film that took the wind out of me with its frank and brutal depiction of desperation and longing. Movies about the Depression that were actually made at the time of the Depression by people who knew of what they spoke by necessity feel so much more authentic than later movies that treat the Depression as a historical event. The men in this film are quite literally living day to day, and the comparison of men to dogs that serves as a running motif throughout the film feels like more than just a poetic device. Like dogs, these men were faced with the scary prospect of some day being of no more use, and there was no system in place to take care of them when that day came. Being shot like a dog put out of its misery by its owner really was preferable to the alternatives awaiting them.<br /><br />I was surprised about how candid this film was, and how bravely it tackled some of the thornier issues of Steinbeck's novel. The incident between Lenny and Mae is divested of some of its sexual overtones, but much is implied anyway. And a scene between Crooks, a black work hand, and some of the other workers, in which Crooks explains in blunt language what it means to be black, tackles race relations as honestly as many films today.<br /><br />Moments of this film are almost unbearably sad and poignant, but never in that over-sentimental way common to Hollywood films of this time period. Burgess Meredith is terrific in the role of George; he expertly conveys--without ever directly addressing it--the bond he has with Lenny and the degree to which Lenny is as much George's savior as he is Lenny's. Charles Bickford is also excellent as a rough and world-weary worker. The cast's weak links are Betty Field--hopelessly overplaying her bored sex kitten--and Lon Chaney as Lenny, though both are very good in the pivotal scene that sets off the action of the film's finale.<br /><br />John Ford's adaptation of \"The Grapes of Wrath\" from the following year gets all of the attention today, and one hardly ever hears of \"Of Mice and Men.\" But much of what is great about Ford's film is also great about Lewis Milestone's, and he deserves credit for laying a fine blueprint for brining Steinbeck's beautiful and heartbreaking stories to the screen.<br /><br />Grade: A\n",

            "Joan Crawford was a star. She was not so much an actress, but a star. She didn't have the craft down to an art form, but boy could she command the screen. In fact, often her larger-than-life persona was too big for the limitations of the movie theatre. And this was especially true during her mid-40s to mid-50s heyday - perfectly coiffed hair, exaggerated eyebrows and all. And Joan was never better than when she was a woman in peril (\"Autumn Leaves\", \"Sudden Fear\") or a woman-on-the-verge. And this brings us to \"Possessed\". Not only was Joan-on-the verge in this film. She goes over-the-edge and somersaults all the way down to the bottom with sheer, unadulterated gusto.<br /><br />In \"Possessed\", Joan is in love with Van Heflin. Van doesn't love Joan the same way and makes this quite clear from the beginning. However, Joan is not able to let go him that easily. She continues to pine away for him even after being rebuffed over and over. Meanwhile, Joan tries to stay busy as the caretaker for the ill wife of Raymond Massey. When the wife dies, Joan and Raymond come together. He wants to be with her so he is not alone. And she wants to be with him hoping that the marriage will lead her down a normal path and steer her clear from her obsessive ways. Once Van Helfin re-enters the scene as the new love interest of Joan's stepdaughter, her delusions and obsessive tendencies once again come to fruition.<br /><br />Joan is great as this woman unraveling at the seams. And Geraldine Brooks is very good in her first major film role as the bitchy stepdaughter who eventually warms up to Joan. However, the men are mediocre. They make you wonder why Joan is even tangled up with them at all. This is excellent film noir. The opening with its thunderous classical piano stylings give way to a smart, stylish film which never slows down. Sure there are better movies about mental illness. \"The Snake Pit\" which stars Olivia De Havilland is a realistic look at the disease. And \"Leave Her To Heaven\" with Gene Tierney is a true noir classic in which Gene goes even more nutso than Joan could dream of. However, \"Possessed\" is a great vehicle for Joan at the top of her game and a solid entry into this classic genre.\n",

The stories that the movie is based on were written by a popular horror writer and that writer is portrayed in the movie by John Carradine. He meets up with a real vampire, played by Vincent Price, who takes him to the \"Monster Club\", which is where the rest of the movie is set. The Monster Club is a strange hippi-like club in which only vampires, werewolves, ghouls or a combination of any of those thru mating can join. The stories start at various times and are interesting with the first being the best, but the silliness surrounding them lessons their impact. Vincent Price has some funny lines but there isn't much else appealing in this movie. The second and third stories are forgettable and therefore the overall affect of the movie is a negative one. The attempt, I believe, was to honor monster movies, but despite many other horror character actors appearing it doesn't do a very good job at this.\n",

Sean Astin puts in a reasonable performance and Vinnie Jones tries hard, but the rest of the cast was appalling. It's almost as if the principal cast was signed up, locations scouted, and then they knocked on doors at their locations and asked people if they wanted to be in a movie. The story had promise but it all fell in a heap. Awful. Time travel movies can tend to be disjointed, but if it's done well it all makes sense in the end.

            "Killer Crocs and Gator movies are a dime a dozen for every \"Alligator\" there is \"Lake Placid 2\". However the concept of a very violent and aggressive Crocodile movie gets me a tad excited. Unfortunately for Primeval more hopes were dashed as we get a tad to much comic relief and way to much political/civil war story and not enough Croc action.<br /><br />The story is about a news crew who are sent in to South Africa to capture a 25 foot long killer Croc dubbed \"Gustave\". Unfortunately for us the film-goer there is a civil war that has broken out which we are surrounded with for much to long of the stories running time. Be it the tribes in the area or the military men that are with them the movie just really wanted to hammer that fact home, with the Crocodile as the side story. We do get the Croc and when it was on screen it was a bad sucker unfortunately they opted for more CGI then you could shake a stick at but it was not of \"The Mummy/Mummy Returns\" crappiness so I guess we can let it slide to a point but would a prosthetic monster Croc be too much to ask for in some of the scenes as it would have been more effective.<br /><br />The shame here is that the whole myth and legend of this creature was very cool but ruined by the fact that we hardly see it for most of the running time. I believe total there is about 20 minutes at best of Croc action. The rest well you get the point. I highly recommend getting the original \"Alligator\" or the lesser known Austrailian Croc film \"Dark Age\" as they are more effective and you get to see what the movie intends for you to see...Croc and gator action.<br /><br />In the end this is a waste of time, it really is a \"just there\" movie with a few good Croc scenes (the cage scene comes to mind). If you have seen all the Croc movies and want to see another well have at it but for the average horror movie/ nature amok fan this one is just not that good.<br /><br />4/10: Below Average: A few Croc scenes that are good otherwise a lame excuse to shove info on South African civil war at us.....go figure?\n",

As for myself, not only did it do that and more, it also had me think about myself, and my current situation in life, and since my country damaged me so hard, I guess in a similar way, I wont experience a great deal if at all. Which makes me appreaciate movies like this one, that for a little while, I can forget the fact that my body is alive, soul wounded, and brain damaged.<br /><br />This is a great movie.\n",

            "I found this movie appealing despite its flaws. Whether you can forgive the flaws depends greatly on what you find hot. Some people find the whole men-behind-bars, dominance/submission, \"young pup manhandled by older, bigger dudes\" scenario highly erotic. Others will be bored during the long stretches between the explicit sex scenes, and probably shouldn't bother watching. These are the critics who complain about porn with pretensions. What they don't understand is that for some viewers, the pretensions -- the attempts at character development -- are part of the porn.<br /><br />The flaws are many and serious, lol. This is a low-budget movie rife with silly stereotypes, bad acting and unintentional humor. Oh, and the music is terrible. But the two stars, Marcel Schlutt and Mike Sale, are a pleasure to look at, there are some very hot scenes, and there are also some surprisingly good non-sexual moments. And Schlutt, considering his inexperience and lack of training, is not a bad actor! He's at least twice as good as Keanu Reeves, though admittedly that's not saying much, and is absolutely adorable in the role of the shy, blushing ingénue. (Watch the cast interview afterwards and you can see he was definitely acting.) Also, in the rape scene, he's disturbingly convincing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Schlutt's co-star, Mike Sale, can't act to save his life, God bless him. It doesn't help that he's supposed to be American and has a British accent, but in a low-budget movie you can overlook things like that. What you can't overlook is a lead actor who reads his lines woodenly, occasionally glancing at the camera, and who's supposed to be the toughest thug in a maximum-security prison but comes across as cuddly and effete. It's kind of cute in a way, lol. I guess there aren't many black actors to choose from in Germany. To be fair, though, he is attractive, and pleasing to watch during the sex scenes.<br /><br />I won't catalog all the things about the movie that are silly, as other critics have covered that in excruciating detail. I will say I couldn't help noticing that the sole African-American character is portrayed as the toughest, most dominant guy in the whole prison, he's the best basketball player, etc., and uses the word m-----f----- once or twice (with a British accent). Personally, I found this rather cute and quaint. It's like a little slice of sociology, seeing how African-American men appear (exotic! feared! revered!) through German eyes.<br /><br />I'll just mention two scenes that surprised me. One is the scene in which Schlutt's character, Dennis, returns to his cell after being outed as having an affair with a black man. The other prisoners chant \"N----- Whore\" over and over again as he's marched down the cell block. It's actually a little scary. And the scene in which the Letarsky character comforts Schlutt's character after the rape is rather touching. Some critics seem to have found that scene funny, so maybe I'm just under-critical or something, but it moved me.<br /><br />So, to summarize: It's undeniably bad in a lot of ways, but I watched it three times, so am giving it 7 out of 10 stars. (I would so never admit to that if I were posting under my real name!)\n",

Brendan Fraser, although somewhat intense with early geekish Elliot Richards, enjoys being there more as the film grows.

            "First of all, let me say I'm a big fan of the other Rankin/Bass Tolkien film, \"The Hobbit.\" Not that \"Hobbit\" is ideal in a lot of ways either -- the story is truncated (although not much changed), the music is quite cute and dated (my girlfriend always says it's like James Taylor's stunted half-brother). But at least it has a complete story to tell, and even the annoying music at least preserves more of Tolkien's poetry than the more ambitious Peter Jackson films of \"LotR\" managed to. I can't really get behind this \"Return of the King\" though.<br /><br />Maybe it would have been different if Ralph Bakshi hadn't won the contract to do \"LotR\", a job that he was clearly not equipped to accomplish. I can understand why the people who controlled \"Lord of the Rings\" used Bakshi instead of Rankin/Bass. Rankin/Bass are very decidedly kiddie-oriented, even if \"Hobbit\" is more mature than their holiday specials. That treatment was appropriate for \"The Hobbit\" which is more of a children's tale although of course it's pleasing to people of all ages. However \"Lord of the Rings\" is a darker tale and deserved a more adult treatment. Bakshi's \"Wizards\" is very impressive, melding documentary footage of nazi war machines with fantasy animation of faeries and goblins. He was given the job of doing \"Lord of the Rings\" basically on the strength of that film.<br /><br />With all of this in mind though, in retrospect it still might have been better if Rankin/Bass had done the whole thing. Bakshi ran out of money in the middle of making his movie, defeated by the demands of rotoscoping technology that had to be invented just to be used for the film. His version was perhaps too ambitious, and when the money ran out they had to cut short the process and the resulting film is not what Bakshi planned nor what fans wanted. It also failed to include this final chapter of the story -- Bakshi had hoped that if his first film made enough money there would be impetus to finish it. So Rankin/Bass was given the sloppy seconds, and they produced a sloppy film that probably doesn't really represent the scope of what they had hoped to do with \"Lord of the Rings\" themselves in the first place.<br /><br />Where Bakshi's attempt was sprawling and relatively faithful, this R/B version of the final chapter paints in very broad strokes. Legolas and Gimli are never even on screen, and Aragorn appears less as a character than as a concept. Considering the length of the movie, such truncations are perhaps necessary. But it's very disheartening for example to hear Frodo yell \"Out of my way, you scum!\" to Gollum, all the depth and nuance of their relationship totally gone. This is not a case like with \"Hobbit\" where leaving out a particular story element like the Arkenstone or Beorn leaves the whole still intact -- with a lot of things missing, even the elements that remain only appear in a warped and inappropriate form.<br /><br />Worthy of praise is much of the voice work on this film, with John Huston returning to anchor the film as Gandalf and narrator, Roddy McDowall lending nuance to Sam, and Theodore is priceless as Gollum even if the character is here robbed of the pathos that he deserves in the books and that he showed in the Rankin/Bass \"Hobbit.\" But some of the voice talent is questionable... perhaps it's just a function of his fame, but it's jarring to hear Casey Kasem as Merry. I think they should have avoided people who had done a lot of voice work in the past and would be recognizable even to children.<br /><br />Much of the actual animation is very poor compared to \"Hobbit\", with only the close-ups having the good quality Japanese style that elevates that film. Whenever characters are seen in a long shot in this film, they look like a children's coloring book. The ringwraiths look comical, like Scooby Doo villains, except for the Witch King who for whatever reason still resembles the scarier wraiths from the Bakshi version. A lot of elements that could have been very cool, like the Army of the Dead, are completely missing from this film and I have to assume it was because they would be too costly and difficult to animate.<br /><br />We're left with a very inadequate film, although it's still good that they finished the trilogy. When I was very young, I had seen these films and could enjoy Tolkien's story through them even though I was too young to appreciate the books. This film in particular was very sought after in the 1980s, because unlike the other two it was not widely available on video. I remember my brother and I had a copy that we had taped off TV which was missing the beginning of the film, and that was the version we had to live with for years. For those who might have spent years searching for it, this version is certainly a disappointment. But it leaves me wondering mostly what the Rankin/Bass effort would have been like if they had been able to do the entire trilogy. Maybe they could have put more effort into some of the characterization and animation. And hopefully someday we will see the books adapted into a really excellent animated film.\n",

            "This is loosely based on events that occurred during Frank Sinatra's tour of Australia where, after referring to a female reporter as a \"two-bit hooker\" he was black-banned by the local unions.<br /><br />Sadly, what could have been an interesting look at a clash of cultures, values and strong-willed individuals descends into something resembling a comedy sketch put on by a country repertory company.<br /><br />Dennis Hopper does a stirling job as Sinatra, with very little directorial support. After a while you start to believe he is Ol' Blue Eyes. But virtually all the other characters are painted in the broad brush strokes of low farce. <br /><br />Joel Edgerton plays the hapless promoter as a dim-witted surfer with a tendency to fall over or get beaten up in every second scene. Portia de Rossi is so loathsome in her role as the maligned journalist that I found myself cheering for Sinatra and the mob for most of the movie.<br /><br />And, in a masterstroke of bizarre casting and makeup, David Field blithely appears on screen looking about as much like Bob Hawke as my mum. Moreover, he seems to have made a conscious decision not to even attempt Hawke's accent, nor any of his well known mannerisms. The overall effect is as if the producers had decided to cast Dame Edna Everage in the role and hope that no-one would notice.<br /><br />Almost every Australian character in the film comes across as either a bumbling half-wit or a self-serving thug. I'm surprised Tourism Australia didn't try to have it banned. The sole exception is the delightful Rose Byrne who, as the love interest/voice of sanity, seems to have been beamed in from a parallel universe.<br /><br />Lamenting the state of the Australian film industry is a national pastime. I think much of it stems from the industry's long love affair with 'daggyness' for its own sake. Who finds this quirky and endearing any more? It's just embarrassing, and the rest of the world obviously thinks so too. This film, with its woeful dialogue, wooden 'school play level' direction, zero character motivation and absurd plot, admirably demonstrates the problem.\n",

            "Seven years ago, when I was in high school, I was assigned to read and study John Steinbeck's 1937 novella, \"Of Mice and Men\", in my English class, and it's no surprise that I still remember it clearly now, as it's not a story to forget. Shortly after reading the book, we were shown the 1992 film adaptation in that class. I first heard about this much earlier adaptation of the book around that time, but it took me seven years to finally get around to watching it, even though I had been intending to watch it for quite a while by the time I did. I knew this version was widely praised, which gave me fairly high expectations. It may not have fully met these expectations, but if not, at least it came very close, and I would say it's just as memorable as the book.<br /><br />In the 1930's Great Depression era, George Milton and Lennie Small are two migrant ranch workers in California who dream of having their own place someday. Lennie is big and strong, but he is also mentally handicapped, and George has to look after him. He means well, but often gets into trouble, doing things he doesn't realize are wrong, and George is always the one who has to get him out of it. After leaving town to escape from a mob started by Lennie feeling a woman's dress, the two of them soon get jobs on another ranch. Here, their co-workers include Candy, an elderly man who won't likely be able to work on the ranch for much longer, and Crooks, a crippled black man who faces discrimination because of his race in this era. The ranch owner's son is Curley, a belligerent young man who hates Lennie from the moment he first sees him, and has a lonely wife named Mae, whom he tends to neglect, but doesn't want any other men to have anything to do with her, being the jealous type.<br /><br />The cast really helps carry this film, including the two co-stars, Burgess Meredith as George and Lon Chaney Jr. (the son of the \"Man of a Thousand Faces,\" Lon Chaney) as Lennie. Both of these actors fit their roles well, and are both memorable. Chaney's portrayal of a mentally handicapped character may not be flawless, but it's still good. Most of the other cast members' performances also stand out, and it helps that they were clearly given a good script. There are times when the score doesn't fit the scene very well, and there may be certain other slight flaws, but they are far from enough to ruin the movie. In addition to the acting and script, there are a number of very interesting characters, several of whom one can easily sympathize with, and some very well crafted heartbreaking scenes, starting with Candy losing his dog. The score in these scenes does fit them well. This adaptation of Steinbeck's novella was also very nicely filmed.<br /><br />This first ever film adaptation of a John Steinbeck story is not perfect, but overall, it's still very good, and very faithful to the book. It does take some liberties, such as giving Curley's wife a name, and they obviously left out some detail, but the differences are minor, at least for the most part. Anyone who has read the book knows that \"Of Mice and Men\" is not a cheerful story. It's a tragic drama set in a tragic era, and this movie is much the same as the book, so keep that in mind if you're planning to watch it. If you're an emotional kind of person, you could easily find tears in your eyes at times, and if you're not, you could still at least come close to tears. If you've read the book and were impressed with it, and/or you like dramas from the classic era in general, I really think this 1939 screen adaptation is worth checking out.\n",

            "Personally, I am a fan of apocalyptic fiction and thoughts of what would happen if the bombs really dropped. I have read all the good books, from Alas Babylon to The Last Ship to Lucifer's Hammer to The Beach. Apparently, the producers and writers of this God-Awful show have not read any of them and seem to have no clue how life might really be like if a small town was isolated by a nuclear holocaust. The writing is so absolutely terrible, they say stuff like \"When I get back to DC, I'm gonna get rid of these clothes!\". What DC, lady? Its gone. Get a clue. Its laughable. After Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans descended into a kind of hell only 24 hours after the storm...looters, gunfire, rapes, a REAL struggle for survival. In Jericho, they seem to have an endless supply of beer at the bar, the booze is flowing, nobody is hungry, they are not defending their city against unknown evils, its hard to imagine that anyone on the writing staff has a clue about what a struggle daily life would really be like in a post-holocaust world. The first van full of Uzi-toting bad guys would mow the town down and they would abduct and rape the women and the men would all be dead. The concept of life after the big one is an interesting premise, but perhaps there has never been a show about a serious subject on the laughable scale as this embarrassment. Rebuilding the world, or what is left of it, is a topic that can engage us for a long time, but the people in this clueless town act like \"oh, a bunch of nuclear bombs wiped out most of our country, when is Oprah on!.\"\n",

            "Did producers of the new South Korean film \"Heaven's Soldiers\" foresee that the six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program would resume in late July? The plot of \"Heaven's Soldiers\" revolves around a group of South and North Korean soldiers who make an unexpected trip through time to the past, while their countries are in feud with the United States over their joint development of a nuclear warhead.<br /><br />From director Min Jun Gi comes the 2005 film Heaven's Soldiers, a nationalistic, military-themed time travel adventure filled with equal parts action and comedy! The story centers on a group of North and South Korean soldiers who find themselves flung back in time just as their respective countries are locked in a tense standoff with the United States over the status of a jointly produced nuclear warhead. The film kicks off with stock footage of the historic meeting between the two Korean leaders in June 2000, using this real life moment as a springboard for the film's fictional premise that North and South Korea secretly formed an alliance, agreeing to co-produce their very own weapon of mass destruction! But when the two Koreas decide to hand over the warhead to the United States, North Korean military officer Kang Min Gil (Kim Seung Woo) decides to take matters into his own hands and not only steal the weapon with the help of a band of private soldiers but kidnap the female South Korean scientist (Kong Hyo Jin) who helped create it as well! Things get even more difficult for Kang as South Korean Navy Officer Park Jeong Woo (Hwang Jung Min) is sent by his superiors to capture the rogue soldier and reclaim the weapon. In the midst of a battle on the DMZ, the soldiers are suddenly transported through time thanks to the appearance of a mysterious comet.<br /><br />In a blink of the eye, the soldiers find themselves trapped in the 16th century, a dark time in Korean history, which saw its countrymen spending most of their time battling off the advances of foreign invaders. After defeating a band of looters with their high-powered machine guns, the time displaced soldiers are hailed as conquering heroes by the locals. Dubbed \"Heaven's Soldiers,\" the group ends up meeting Yi Sun Shin (Park Joong Hoon), the real life admiral who led Korea to victory against the Japanese.<br /><br />However, the legendary Yi isn't quite what the soldiers expected. Rather than the mythical hero of legend he's thought to be in the present day, the Yi the soldiers encounter is actually a thief and a rascal, one who can't even pass the officer's exam! Shocked that their hero could be so lax in his studies, the soldiers give Yi a crash course in military education, all in the hopes he'll fulfill his destiny! But will Yi discover his true calling in time or will he doom both himself and his beloved country? Find out in Heaven's Soldiers, a crowd-pleasing time travel epic!\n",

It was well done, all right, if you ignored the tedious lines, the \"absurd theater\" construction and the utter lack of imagination which rendered the situations as completely uninspired and made you go \"ahhh come on...\" I will not even waste my time on explaining all the reasons I thought this movie was purely awful, I just want to know how anybody can think it was beautiful, clever or touching... And I would also like to know how a movie which is as \"real\" as Liz's life is considered authentic and worth watching. Everything in there is completely unauthentic, situations are poorly constructed, the love story is a sick twisted tale which escapes the rules of common reasonable sense, and that does not make the movie great. When a movie surprises you it just becomes unpredictable and that effect can be easily obtained once you completely turn a situation upside down, this does not mean that if you are taken by surprise you should bow to the imagination of the writer.<br /><br />God, this was one of the worst ever.

I don't blame him; this is the film world where even since this period - around 1920 - marriage is always trivialized and people are always lying. Why was that so frequent in classic movies, in particular? It's disgusting. Here Alfred \"Battling\" Butler, a spoiled rich young man - in order to keep his girl - lies about being the lightweight boxing champion of the world, because that guy, who has the same name as him, is a hero and he wants to impress her and her big brother and big father. He wants to marry her right away because she's pretty and she consents as soon as she hears he's a big shot. Boy, those are great reasons for marriage!<br /><br />After the quickie marriage, Buster heads off for training camp for his supposed title defense against the \"Alabama Murderer.\" Later, the real \"Battling Butler,\" to do the impostor a favor and save his marriage, lets him be the real thing and fight while he retires.<br /><br />The training - and the first real laugh of the film - isn't until 47-minute mark when Buster begins training and can't get over the ropes. He is helpless outside and inside the ring as it turns out.<br /><br />The training escalates as Buster begins roadwork the next day.....but he isn't up to training or fighting or any of this. Fortunately, a big twist occurs late in the movie which saves Buster from going into the ring, although the little man does save his honor after he fights the real \"Battling Butler.\"<br /><br />I would agree with the critics on this one: it's far from Buster's best work.\n",

Don's character is very funny, and he plays both sides of it well, and as for Salma...let's just say the directors are aware of what their male audience wants to see.<br /><br />All in all, it's funny, quick, easy to follow, and contains enough little quirks to make After the Sunset an enjoyable and entertaining experience.\n",

            "Sanjay Gupta's Aatish is a straight, shameless lift from John Woo's \"Ying Huang Boon\" (A Better Tomorrow).<br /><br />John Woo's Ying Huang Boon Sik/A Better Tomorrow(1986) was groundbreaking when first released because of the stylistic depiction of the action scenes. Its success spurred a new genre in Hong Kong cinema known as Heroic Bloodshed. These films were usually gangster movies which were characterized by outrageous gun battles, heavy action, and high melodrama. Hong Kong cinema in the mid 1980s to early 1990s was in the midst of a gangster film craze similar to Hollywood in the 1930s-1940s, France in the 1950s-1960s, Japan in the 1960s-1970s, and Italy in the 1970s-1980s. A Better Tomorrow(1986) is to Heroic Bloodshed what A Fistful of Dollars(1966) was to the Spaghetti Western.<br /><br />A Better Tomorrow focuses on the age old themes of honor and loyalty. The characters of Ho and Mark are honorable gangsters in an era of double crosses and mistrust. Ho and Mark are at odds with the changing value system and this puts them as people who are outmoded in their principles. Honor and loyalty in A Better Tomorrow(1986) is greatly emphasized as the marks of a good hearted person. Mark Gor is very honorable and loyal in his personalty compared to Shing who is the opposite.<br /><br />John Woo's main concern is to place high importance on the idea of brotherhood. According to John woo in this film, the tight bonding between men is something that was lost among youngsters at that time. Brotherhood in the film is complex and emotional. The relationship between Ho and Mark is so strong that there is nothing that can smash it. The scene where Mark tells of his ordeals at a nightclub as a first time gangster is nostalgic and touching.<br /><br />Famous for the clothes Mark Gor wears as for anything else in the film. Began a trend in fashion around Hong Kong when many people started wearing the same kind of outfit as Mark Gor. Quentin Tarantino loved the look of Mark that for weeks he dressed like him to feel and look cool. In John Woo films there is always focus on the fashion of his characters. Mark Gor was the Rick Blaine of the 1980s.<br /><br />A Better Tomorrow(1986) changed the look of action films with the famous use of pistols by Brother Mark in the restaurant. The first of many elaborate gun battles that dominates the films that follows A Better Tomorrow(1986). Although John Woo would film many wonderful action scenes in the next few years, there never would be a scene like this one which is full of energy and freshness. I enjoyed it when Mark Gor places guns inside flower pots as backup because the idea is cleaver and original. This scene is parodied in the climatic portion of Just Heroes(1987).<br /><br />Ying Huang Boon Sik(1986) gave stardom to an actor known for his roles in Hong Kong television named Chow Yun Fat. Before the film's success, Chow Yun Fat was considered box office poison in Hong Kong. His charismatic and suave performance as the tragic Mark Gor broke that reputation. Chow Yun Fat is the best actor to come out of Asian cinema since Toshiro Mifune and Jo Shishido. He is the most flamboyant actor in the world who is better than any actor that was nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars.<br /><br />The motif of sacrifice for redemption is part of Woo's religious beliefs. The heroes in his bloodshed films perform sacrifices to purify themselves within. The death of Mark Gor is a big sacrifice because it makes Ho and Kit Brothers again. What's sad about the death of Mark is its the only way for Ho and Mark to reconcile with each other. This motif also plays big in The Killer(1989) and Bullet in the Head(1990). The story is simple but compelling. Ti Lung made a big comeback with his role after years of mediocrity. He gives a performance that is deeply emotional and mature. Leslie Cheung also performs well as the headstrong but naive and stubborn Kit Sung. Waise Lee is excellent as the pompous and two faced Triad boss, Shing.<br /><br />Gunfight at the end of A Better Tomorrow is less high body count and refined than in later John Woo films. Still exhilarating and fun to watch. The shootout is filmed in the spirit of Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone. When Chow Yun Fat comes out shooting like John Wayne, the film is at a high adrenaline level. One of the reasons why I love this movie.<br /><br />Plot becomes more emotionally intense and less melodramatic with the energetic direction of John Woo. What makes the film work is the large dose of sentiments given by John Woo. He films the action and dramatic scenes with much passion and thoughtfulness. He is good at directing Chow Yun Fat and Ti Lung in giving great performances. A Better Tomorrow(1986) made John Woo an action guru after years doing comedies and being known as the king of comedy in Hong Kong cinema.<br /><br />However, the copying was done in an excellent way. Aditya Panscholi in Chow-Yun-Fat's role does a wonderful job. His best performance in his not-so-good career as an actor. Sanjay Dutt, as usual, is awesome. No credit to the Director, Editor and Screenplay-writer as all they did was shameless copying. The superb acting performances by Dutt and Panscholi make the movie to a nice watch but the makers make it a pathetic downer by stealing everything scene-by-scene in to-to.\n",

            "Here is a movie musical what is a movie musical! Forget the story! It is slight at best, involving a he-man (Scott) inheriting a designing house in Paris. It comes complete with assistant (Dunne) and a phony countess (Rogers) and a band (complete with Astaire as leader) which has come to Paris with him. Why he is traveling with the band, or why Rogers is getting away with the phony royalty bit is never really explained. To be honest, the first half of the movie is totally missable and rather confusing. Scott as a love interest? Unable to see it. Dunne as a singer? Hard to take. Having said that, then, there is the dancing of Astaire and Rogers, unmatched by anyone before or since. No wonder tap and ballroom dancing has gone somewhat out of vogue. Once you see these two perform, everything and everyone else is a letdown. The music of Jerome Kern is some of the best ever put out for a movie. If you're under 35, you may never have had the opportunity to listen to \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\", \"I Won't Dance\" and the rest. Do yourself a favor - watch this movie just for the music and dancing. A wag once said that Fred Astaire looked so good in a tuxedo that he rented himself out to them. No one else looks so at ease in top hat and tails. The clothes are dated, maybe, but you get an idea of what real glamour can be. Yards and yards of exotic looking material draped over some delicious looking models, including a brief glimpse of the redoubtable Lucille Ball! Well worth the time it takes to watch!!\n",

            "What is the point of this documentary? From a film perspective this was not worthwhile. The film & editing was bad. It seems that much of the film was a forum for someone's favorite iTunes list. Many images are frankly irrelevant to the film. Little continuity. I think the filmmaker is stuck with footage that cannot be redone and somehow threw it all together. I'm amazed that anyone is rallying behind this as a film.<br /><br />I understand that in a crisis situation such as this, some footage will be choppy, shaky, etc which adds to the experience of the crisis. However, even in the controlled environments - interviews after the fact - the camera shakes, moves in & out unnecessarily, and gives ridiculous close-ups. There was precious little information about any pet rescue. A few statistics thrown in.<br /><br />Jane Garrison's story is compelling and this should be more about her alone. Sub-lines would be the inter-agency conflicts, the animal murders by law enforcement, and REUNIONS with pets. A fuller investigation of these on film would make it worthwhile.<br /><br />I think there are many promising story lines that are just dropped. What is in the film does not gel at all to make a documentary. The film ends with some random images from the Barkus pet parade. What connection did this have to anything about the animal rescue, just because it was New Orleans? I'm getting even more angry as I type, thinking how much of a waste this was.\n",

            "Because it's a newer version of a classic horror movie (and it went directly to video), I have been putting off watching Stuart Gordon's take on Edgar Allen Poe's classic story, but after finally catching it; I can honestly say that I don't know why I didn't see it earlier! While the Roger Corman/Vincent Price version of the tale is far better, this update still has a lot in store for the horror fan, most notably it's superb European styled atmosphere, and a fine performance by Lance Henriksen, which may even be the best of his career. While these elements are contributors to the film's success, the main reason why the film works is the story behind it. Of course, it's based (albeit loosely) on Poe's classic tale, so the story is bound to be solid; but it doesn't take all of it's influence from Poe, and so Dennis Paoli can take a lot of credit for the screenplay he wrote for the movie. The idea of 'the pendulum', along with a 'pit' can conjure up many feelings of dread and pain, and this film adequately capitalises on that with it's excellent torture filled finale! <br /><br />As mentioned, Lance Henriksen gives what is maybe his best performance in this film. He is both powerful and frightening in his role as Torquemada, the head witchfinder of the Spanish Inquisition. When he says \"I am the inquisition\", it's enough to make your hairs stand on end. Henriksen is a criminally underrated actor and one that certainly deserves more praise...it's just unfortunate that he tends to shine in movies that don't get noticed. Also in the cast is 'Re-Animator' himself, Jeffrey Combs, who shines in a small role as someone in the inquisition. The film isn't wholly serious, and Stuart Gordon has seen fit to add some comic relief to the proceedings, which is OK but I feel that the movie would be better off without any 'relief'. Certain elements from other Poe stories appear, such as a man being bricked in behind a wall, and this film seems to treat it's subject material with respect. The European horror style is a major plus factor in my opinion, and should please fans of movies from the sixties and seventies. On the whole; surprisingly good!\n",

The best part of the movie was the end. It barely followed the plot of the book, cut out more than half of the major events, and was cut way too short. I wouldn't see this movie again if someone threatened to force feed me nails. It was very cheesy, especially the two minute period in which Saphira magically grows up; also, periods that spanned two months in the book spanned several hours in the movie. The ONLY reason I gave the movie a three out of ten, was because of the good animation on Saphira. This movie is an insult to all loyal Eragon fans. To summarize: if you have read the book, don't see the movie. After seeing the movie, me and my Eragon loving friends had a conversation on how stupid and idiotic the movie was. After seeing how crappy Eragon was, we are scared to see Eldest.<br /><br />~Kristina (A VERY angry fan)\n",

I'm guessing its more of a pride/symbolic representation in the script itself.\n",

            "I was surprised to find that Ghost World is a comic book adaptation. The film is full of quirkiness and a same-time embracing of geeks/dorks as well as pitying them. We start with two semi-outcast high school students graduating high school. From then, we primarily follow Enid (Thora Birch), who finds herself in an existential phase of her life, having escaped from her hated experience, but finding herself in a meaningless and pointless world, with little direction of her own. And this is a comedy that somehow works, even when burdened by such philosophical weight.<br /><br />The comedy in Ghost World is not the gut-busting type, but rather the quiet situational type that's amusing. At the same time, as we laugh at the nerds, geek, freaks, dorks and dweebs that inhabit Ghost World, the film works to humanize them in our eyes and raise a sympathy for them. Suddenly their eccentricities seem less strange and more interesting. And like Enid, we find ourselves drawn to them.<br /><br />This film has a bit in common in terms of tone with the heavier American Splendor as well as the lighter Napoleon Dynamite, featuring an offbeat humor style and complete with curious characters. Despite the comedy, this film is a drama at its core, dealing with a youth's entry to the \"real world\", complete with all its harshness and disappointments. As we watch the film, we see her best-friendship with Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) tested, struggle with young love and infatuation and try to find her way in a world that doesn't feed her direction, but asks her to discover it for herself. And like many young people, she finds it very difficult to deal with the responsibility.<br /><br />And in the drama, we find the heart of the film, watching Enid with compassionate eyes through her struggles.<br /><br />Steve Buscimi completes the primary cast as Seymour, a jazz/blues geek who Enid takes on as her first mission once she graduates, finding in him a sort of spiritual corollary. The performances are solid, with the humor played deadpan and the drama dramatic. The direction is of the classic invisible Hollywood style and the pace of the film is fine. I think the ending is a little bit of a cop-out, but I guess that's how some stories go.<br /><br />I thought it was a good, quirky little film and if you're a fan of those kinds of films, I'd recommend Ghost World to you. 8/10\n",

Certainly not as violent as the \"Dirty Harry\" pictures, but just as unsubtle, it was a powerful movie with a totally convincing, appropriately square performance by Joe Don Baker. <br /><br />The first sequel, in which Baker was replaced by Bo Svenson, was a boring, by-the-numbers follow-up, with none of the force of the original.<br /><br />The second sequel is even worse; talky and drab, it exploits (in an almost cannibalistic way) the first movie by lifting and recreating the most famous sequences from it.

In a scene that is somewhere halfway (actually I bet it's precisely halfway) you get the clue you need: there's no beginning and no end in this movie, so don't bother yourself looking for it. Once this is taken for granted, you see some quite excellent scenes, in which you are in the thick of things of the life of some (more of less) loose connected people. There is humour, affection, love, lust and sadness, and most of the players are very convincing. The only character that could be missed in my opinion was Linda, played by Franka Potente: she is playing exactly the same character as she was in 'Lola rennt' (without the running). Just an irritatingly weird girl, with no real or convincing acts and emotions, except her singing her own flamenco song. If Franka Potente can't play a character unlike Lola, I'm sorry to say I've seen enough of her by now.\n",

            "The demented genius behind A VISIT FROM THE INCUBUS strikes again. Seriously, though, what is VIVA? Caught this about seven months ago and am still trying to take it all in. I loved this film because I never knew what was going to happen next, despite it following the model of '60's/'70's sexploitation films pretty closely. The first few minutes are simply exhilarating. A young housewife leafs through a skin mag in her bathtub, gets herself ready for the outside world, and blasts off in some bad-ass muscle car, just as the wonderful piece of vintage loungecore music on the soundtrack reaches a crescendo. (At least that's how I remember it.) Sublime; I'm at a loss to think of a better opening scene. (TOUCH OF EVIL, studio cut, perhaps? It's too close to call.) Then we settle in for the long haul. The housewife is hanging out with her friends, a married couple. Things get inappropriate. How far will it go? Exactly what kind of a movie is this? That's really the question that VIVA dares the viewer to answer. I'm still not sure. Satire or pornography? Happily, the answer is yes.<br /><br />The film is two hours. That would be hard to justify if it were just a slavish imitation of vintage softcore porn. Or just a spoof of same. Instead, it's almost a suspense film. How long has it been since an American film had me wondering who among the cast was going to disrobe? Who was going to disrobe NEXT? Who will have sex next? Will it even be consensual?! All those people constantly cruising each other. Predatory. With the color-soaked visual panache of Radley Metzger in Eastmancolor, but with a storyline from a Joe Sarno film where everyone thinks and talks about sex all the time, has weird, anonymous, masked sex all the time, and never enjoys it. Almost exactly like the adult world seemed to me in 1972. Plus deadly serious feminist self-reflexivity for the unwashed masses and nude dancers with their wieners bobbing hilariously for intellectuals like myself, courtesy of a nudist camp scene that is exactly like Blake Edwards WOULD have done it in A SHOT IN THE DARK, if Hollywood censorship had already relaxed, and he was on angel dust. And all the while, the deliciously arch Jared Sanford does his best to act dozens of naked people off the screen. Two hours was barely enough. Bring on the 70mm IMAX release, the three-disc DVD special edition with the signed and numbered lithographs, and the \"Vote for Viva\" t-shirts in every trendy mall novelty store.\n",

It would have made an interesting 20 minute short MAYBE, but as a feature film, it meandered too often. Drago was the main draw for this one, as Danny Trejo, normally great, is just plain weird in the movie. Too make matters worse the nudity is very poorly lit.<br /><br />Eye Candy: it's very darkly lit, but Ananda St. James does bare her humongous rack<br /><br />My Grade: D+\n",

            "This was not a good film , it wasn't even a good horror film. The first Child's Play has scenes of actual suspense, but this one is more jokey than anything else. Some of the characters do die in fairly novel ways, but Chucky doesn't seem to have the zest that he had in the original. There are some good special effects, especially towards the end of the film, and the puppetry being Chucky was excellent, but it seemed a bit of a waste of time. If they were going to put all this money and effort into making sure the special effects were good, then they really should have made sure they had some kind of storyline, and some reason to make the film. As it stands the film seems cold, with as much inspiration in at as a McDonalds commercial. Stick to the first one only, if you are going to watch any of the Chucky films.\n",

He burns up a rescue boat and the communication equipment and stalks the characters with a machete.<br /><br />High-pedigree slasherama from England has the novely of above-average production values and acting and some well-done suspense scenes to go along with some pretty grisly slayings (neck slashings and decapitations being the killer's forte).

Like the chicken, forced to be \"programmed\" by a wall of televisions, we are all stuck with the billions of programs our monopolistic cable providers choose for us. Piped into our homes, our creativity sits on the shelf while we down popcorn in front of the bluish glare of the glass boob-tube. Sure, there are a billion programs to choose from, but they follow a pattern of acceptability that thinks for us so that we don't have to.<br /><br />Robot Chicken breaks the mold! It isn't ashamed of anything! It makes us think! It reflects life through the animation of toys  real life that non-thinkers shrug away from. And the low-budget animation is perfect in the sense that it doesn't detract from the message.

Benicio Del Toro was excellent, he really made the role his own, like it was written with him in mind. Any other actor wouldn`t have worked. Let`s just hope we see a lot more of him in the future. Fair enough, the plot wasn`t exactly rocket science, but the story was told really well and watching it was a real escape from everyday life.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to everyone (although maybe the romantics out there would probably appreciate it the most!!). Although Alicia Silverstone played her part well, Del Toro, with his simple, bumbling ways, really made the movie for me. Definitely A*\n",

            "With the sexual revolution of the '60s, there of course would have to be a movie about sex. \"Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice\" was it. Having visited a therapy group, Bob and Carol Sanders (Robert Culp and Natalie Wood) have become more open about their sexuality, and are identifying more with the counterculture in general. Their repressed friends, Ted and Alice Henderson (Elliott Gould and Dyan Cannon) can't seem to get into it. But while in a hotel room in Las Vegas, after they've all revealed some secrets, they decide to have an orgy. You've probably seen the picture of the four of them in bed together.<br /><br />When this movie came out, many critics thought that it had a cop-out ending. In an interview, director Paul Mazursky explained that he felt that they only could go as far as they eventually went. Anyway, you can't judge an entire movie by one individual scene; it's what the movie's saying overall that matters. As for the characters, Bob seems sort of wooden, Carol is hot (as Natalie Wood always was), Ted is a dork, and Alice is a little eccentric. Overall, it's a pretty good movie.\n",

            "Communion is a wonderful film, and one of the scariest movies ever made. In order for some people to cover up their fears, they want to mock this movie, the idea of aliens, and anyone who claims to have had contact with them. Whitley Strieber brings this up in his book, so it doesn't surprise me that some people smirk at this film. <br /><br />The fact that Christopher Walken is in this movie only increases these immature people's drive to turn every role Walken does as a comedy. I feel bad for Walken. Too many people don't take him seriously anymore. He's one of the greatest actors in the world, yet a lot of fans want to turn every one of his performances as a joke, and make fun of him and/or just not take his work seriously.<br /><br />Then they wanna point out the \"lack of the special effects. Now I personally thought the special effects were great, but compared to a modern day movie on HDTV/blu-ray, of course it's not going to be the same. It was the 80's. You people who are spoiled by CGI need to understand that. It's also worth mentoining that the 80's was also an era where movie makers didn't go and remake everything like so many people are doing today. and there are more to movies then special effects, like good acting, and a great story, and Communion has that, but some people's immature ways of thinking blinds them to that.<br /><br />People fear what they don't understand, and that fear soon grows to hate, and some people express their hate differently. Some people just wanna smirk, and make bad jokes, and mock what they fear.<br /><br />Aliens are the most realistic \"monsters\" in the horror world, and everyone knows that. Any one of us could be a victim to alien abduction. That is where the discomfort of it all comes in, and for anyone to think we humans are the only living creatures in this giant universe is just plan egotistic.<br /><br />I have seen a lot of movies in my life. Way too many in fact, but out of the hundred's and hundred's of films I've seen, I must say that Communion is truly the scariest motion picture that my eyes have watched. It scared me as a child, it scared me as a teenager and it scares me as man. I have never seen a movie that makes me feel more uneasy.<br /><br />I first remember when I was a little kid being in Mann's video store in Bridge City, Texas and seeing the VHS cover of Communion and seeing the alien face really scared me.<br /><br />Communion is the only horror film to ever make me revert back to being a child. I tried to watch it when I was 24, and as I was watching a very scary scene, my body began to experience the \"fight or flight\" system. My feet felt weird, my heart was pumping, I got goosebumps and I was sweating. No movie has EVER made me experience that and I don't think any other movie ever will. Even watching it during the day time, it scared me just as much. It scared me so much that I actually almost screamed in one part but gasped instead, and twice I had to turn it off and stop watching it because it scared me that much. <br /><br />The reason why it scares me is because since early childhood I've suspected that I may be a victim to alien abduction. I know that sounds crazy and it's most likely not true (at least I have to tell myself it's not in order to sleep at night) but there's always going to be a part of me that will always be scared of aliens.<br /><br />Communion is the only movie that takes me right into the film. I watch so many different scenes in this movie and I think....\"I've been there.\" I know what it's like to wake up late at night and wonder if I'm alone in my room. I decided not to even finish it back then because it's way too intense.<br /><br />Perhaps one day I'll watch the movie again. I'm right in the middle of reading the book now for the first time, and it's pretty scary too.<br /><br />If you have a fear of aliens like I do and you have never seen Communion but thought about watching it....I highly recommend you avoid it. It WILL scare you.\n",

The sheer lunacy of \"roughing it\" with all the comforts of home, including one's own butler, is inspired. This sequence in the wilds contains all of the best gags: wildfowl all around but unobserved by our hero; the duck who keeps ducking under the boat when Buster is trying to get organized to shoot it; the dinner table slowly sinking in the mud; the heroine walking a lost Buster back to his camp after he has gallantly walked her home.<br /><br />In contrast the rest of the film has only the eight mile run dupe and Buster combating with the fighting ring ropes to make us chuckle. That's a lot of film time with nothing amusing happening. Buster seems to have become uninspired once the pathos of the mistaken identity narrative take over. Still it's worth seeing the film for the first sequence.<br /><br />KINO's print is crisp and clear and the music accompanying their print is made up of player organ, drums, violin and triangle.\n",

It is not meant to be a recreation of Barrie's brilliant and timeless story... it is, well, sort of a sequel in a way. It's a \"what if\" scenario, just one option of many. It's very cleverly tied closely to the original story, with many references woven throughout the entire storyline, if not as much in the plot itself. The creativity in every aspect of the film is very impressive, and a better cast could not have been chosen. Any fan of NeverNeverland and the story of Peter Pan is sure to immensely enjoy this movie. It even enforces family values and has a great moral to the story (especially for those who have suddenly surprisingly found themselves grown up!)\n",

            "This is a meandering, rather oddball film which hopefully gave its stars a nice vacation in Italy (at a time when production was booming there), but did nothing for their careers. Esther plays a successful model working in Rome, but involved with a wealthy American tycoon back home. He sends word to her via his sleazy European partner and friend Carlos Thompson that his wife will not give him a divorce to marry her. Dejected Esther immediately agrees to go with Thompson on a yachting party thrown by another millionaire off Majorca. Thompson, however, crashes his private plane carrying them in a storm onto a tiny island near Sardinia.<br /><br />This island is populated only by Eduardo de Filippo, his nubile and soon-to-be of age daughter Rosanna Podesta, and Jeff Chandler, a mysterious beachcomber who is betrothed to Podesta and helps out de Filippo. Rik Battaglia plays a date farmer from the mainland who is Chandler's rival for Podesta's affections. The rest of the film, which keeps a fairly light tone while throwing in bits of melodrama and a badly done attempt at action at the end, involves Williams' and Thompson's efforts to get off of the island while unraveling the mystery of who Chandler is and what he is doing there.<br /><br />The only real interest the film has is the pretty Mediterranean scenery and the only teaming of Williams and Chandler, who were engaged for a time. Williams later did her best to posthumously trash Chandler's reputation in her autobiography by describing him as a cross-dresser! Not a very gallant thing for her to do, but whether or not it was true at least it might have livened things up a bit if Jeff had modeled some of Esther's frocks in this pointless exercise.\n",

Finding this movie, I thought it would be a nice addition to contemporary Jewish cinema with films like the excellent \"the believer\". However I was very very wrong.<br /><br />This is a bad film in every sense of the word bad. 1. very bad acting (the guy's friend was so obnoxious, I couldn't stand to watch him) 2. very shallow and uninspired script (Half of the script is just stupid rambling about f-cking, supposed to signify lecherous new york life) 3. mediocre movie making<br /><br />This really looks and feels like a student film, and a pretty bad one. The only thing this guys got right is the DVD box which is pretty cool.<br /><br />For me as someone interested in the line between religious Judaism and secular Jews, this film was a major disappointment and embarrassment. It is filled with the worst kind of stereotypes about orthodox Jews and about secular new-yorkers. Some parts got me so disgusted I could hardly watch it.<br /><br />It wouldn't have made me so angry, if it weren't that this film even won awards in different film festivals like the San Paolo film festival, Bendfilm festival and Brooklyn festival. How on earth can that be??? I can't believe they didn't find better films to give awards to. Probably the politics of cinema played some parts here.<br /><br />Anyway, spare your time.

            "Known as LONG AGO TOMORROW, THE RAGING MOON is possibly the most intriguing movie in the career of young Malcolm MacDowell. It came after his breakthrough film IF, and before the films most people recall he starred in: A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and O LUCKY MAN. MacDowell is nowadays established as a well known character actor who specializes in powerful or power-mad villains for the most part. On an episode of LAW AND ORDER a few years back he was a twisted version of Rupert Murdoch. He is frequently rogue CIA agents, or tycoons with secret agendas. And he is wonderful in all these roles. But except for O LUCKY MAN it is hard to find MacDowell playing a sympathetic and simple type. His salesman in O LUCKY MAN is naive and believes what line is ever given to him by his employers. But in THE RAGING MOON he was a strong, athletic young man whose future is wrecked by a physical accident that cripples him. And he has to try to fight his anger at this unfair situation and regain his self respect.<br /><br />McDowell plays Bruce Prichard, a soccer/rugby player who is injured in a game - and left wheelchair bound at the age of 21. Given that sport was the key to his life, the props have been knocked out from underneath him in more than one way. He slowly develops into a determined man who is going to overcome his permanent handicap. What really turns him into a determined type is his meeting with another patient (also similarly crippled) named Jill Matthews (Nanette Newman). The two young people find they are encouraging each other's recovery. And sooner or later they begin falling in love.<br /><br />It is the oddest role in MacDowell's career, and he handles very well. Basically, except for the first ten minutes of the film, he is stuck in bed or in his wheelchair. He is bitter, but fixed on getting on with his new life. Andd finally he is enchanted by his new friend, confidante, and lover Newman. In one of the most touching scenes of the film, the two lovers figure out how to embrace in their wheelchairs by turning them on parallel lines to each other, and lowering the right arms of the wheelchairs so they can surround their arms about each other's waists and chests. The viewer can see the difficulties the young people will face, but they see they will do what they can to overcome their joint disability. So that the audience ends up cheering for them.<br /><br />MacDowell is not usually so sympathetic. His anti-hero in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is tormented by the state in a new process to make him an acceptable (if defenseless) citizen, and then tormented by one of his old victims. But he was a stylish but still vicious punk in most of that film. He may symbolize youthful suspicions against an antiquated establishment in IF, but he is a violent rebel in the end. And due to his crass stupidity in O LUCKY MAN he actually commits fraud. But in THE RAGING MOON he struck a different note - and it was one he rarely hit again in any films or television shows he made. <br /><br />The ultimate fate of his hero and heroine, and the cruelty of the world and nature they face, enhance the film. At the conclusion he is stunned by events. So is his audience. And nobody can explain why what happened had to be final for his dreams.\n",

Fred Mac Murray's cop starts out as a professional but ends up in a vortex of crime thanks to the compelling allure of the shapely Miss Novak. Good thing she's called on to do little more than stand around looking sexy, because her bad, breathy imitation of Marilyn M. in the opening garage scene had me reaching for the off button. I gather Columbia (read Harry Cohn) had high hopes of launching Novak's career with this role. Too bad she had to compete with a hundred other bosomy blonde Marilyn's for the honor. I like the seduction scene with its subtly unzipped zipper, about as far as the screen could go at that time. The plot wrinkles get pretty complicated at times, but the pace keeps moving nicely along. Then too, the final line presents a poignant slice of ironic insight.There's the inevitable comparison here with the thematically similar Double Idemnity, but then Novak is no Stanwyck and MacMurray is a ten dissipated years older. Still, this little suspenser needs no help from the past and can stand firmly on its own.\n",

A lot of the local stuff that showed there was only so-so but this one really stood out for us - first of all there were tons of people waiting to get in to the screening dressed like the film's major characters (particularly Erin) which surprised us. The film itself was really well-shot and the story and acting were a cut above what we were used to seeing at festivals. I'm sure other postings already hit on this, but the score was amazing and the cinematography really stood out - lots of interesting colors, some desolate wide shots and really inventive camera angles. Keep in mind this is a twisted and sad fairy tale, not a straight-up horror film, but it manages to be fun, campy, really dramatic and pretty eerie all in 90 minutes.

            "Charles Grodin and Cybill Shepherd star in this off beat comedy that ends up being more dramatic and poetic than funny. Charles Grodin has always been on the border line when it comes to being funny and serious. Much of his comedy career has been played serious and his dramatic appeal is sometimes hilarious. Unlike Chaplin, Keaton or the Marx Brothers, Grodin's punchline is not necessarily funny. Most of the times, the outcome of the joke / hilarious situation turns into a political / ethical realization. Grodin's character is likable but by the end of the movie you either lose total interest in the character or you become so attached to him that you feel bad during the final frame of the story. In many ways, Grodin resembles a young W.C. Fields character where you hope for his achievement in the relationship with Cybill Shepherd and his family. Then again, Grodin puts himself into situations where he is the butt of the joke and the victim of the circumstance. A wonderful movie, made before its time. The Heartbreak Kid is a story about a middle aged kid (much like Fields) who is in need of getting his heart broke.\n",

The acting is subpar, the editing worse and the story was a bit biased. We all thought that this production was going to do justice to the life and achievements of Lavoe. Instead it is an embarrassing account of the negative aspect of Hector's life. Yes he did drugs, yes he had many trying times, but he also left a musical legacy that many of today's Salsa singers (Marc Anthony included) can't and never will achieve. This was a chance to celebrate the artist and his contributions along with Willie Colon to our popular music. Instead we have all the dark aspects that clouded his life and show old Salsa artists to be a bunch of \"junkies\" and bums. Also, you can clearly notice that this is a \"Jennifer Lopez production\" since a lot of the \"actors\" in the movie are blood relatives of J-Lo. This is a low blow for these artists and I can believe Jenny to ride Marc's fame as much as she can since she can't sell a movie by herself, much less a singing career. I was very disappointed in Marc and as a puertorican I can say that ever since he got together with J-Lo he has lost a lot of ground with us puertoricans and this travesty of a movie clearly shows it. You really need to know the real story here if you want to comment on this \"movie\". All I saw was J-Lo's face and big \"rump\" more times than the actual main character of the movie. I counted about forty-something appearances from Marc and over 200 by J-Lo. Way to go girl, keep riding the bronco until it drops.\n",

            "The American oil company KIC Corporation is building an ice road to explore the remote Northern Artic National Wildlife Refuge seeking energy independence. Independent environmentalists work together in a drilling base headed by the tough Ed Pollack (Ron Perlman) in a sort of agreement with the government, approving procedures and sending reports of the operation. When one insane team member is found dead naked on the snow, the environmentalist James Hoffman (James Le Gros) suspects that sour gases may have been accidentally released in the spot provoking hallucinations and insanity in the group. After a second fatal incident, he convinces Ed to travel with the team to a hospital for examination. However, weird events happen trapping the group in the base.<br /><br />\"The Last Winter\" is intriguing, beginning like \"The Thing\" blended with \"An Inconvenient Truth\" in wonderful locations in Iceland. Then the story shifts to a rip-off of \"The Shining\", ending in a complete and disappointing ambiguous mess. Ron Perlman plays an unpleasant character, and it is impossible to feel any empathy for Ed Pollack. It seems that the unknown director and writer Larry Fessenden was also affected by the hallucinogen gas of the story and end the movie completely mad, showing a weak answer of the nature in spite of having a plot with great potential. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"Colapso no Ártico\" (\"Collapse in the Artic\")\n",

It's what actually transpires after the prison break, so you need an imagination. Right from the start there is enough profanity and blood for ten movies. There are quite a few derogatory statements made against the female gender too. It was just to much, possibly an over kill. I didn't totally trash it because I thought some of the acting was decent and seeing a real SWAT team was pretty cool for a no budget movie. Another reason I didn't give it a low score of 1 because of a short that is on the DVD which in turn was pretty good. I also took into account that the film maker appears to have made a genuine effort in comparison to some of the other no budget trash I have seen.\n",

            "Why is everybody giving so high ratings to this? Come on, the movie is absolutely boring! I'm not a hardcore horror movies fan, but I still enjoy watching one or two when there's something interesting to watch. Believe me, this is NOT one of those.<br /><br />\"The orphanage\" is a long, boring, no-scares, no-suspense, and totally overrated flick that almost made me fall asleep. I could have forgive the story's lack of originality if its narrative or pace would have been good... But they weren't. However, there's no reason to panic because even if the script is bad, at least the characters and dialogue are very well done, right? WRONG. They are dull and very poorly developed. The mix didn't work at all and there were many scenes that seemed false or even ridiculous to me.<br /><br />What more can I say, lately is a common practice for me to consult some IMDb users's reviews before paying any serious attention to some foreign flick I don't know much about, but the truth is... I don't know if that will keep being useful for me. I mean... Boy, I expected way, way more of this one. It really doesn't deserve all the good treatment that has received here.<br /><br />The only two reasons for the stars I'm giving are the fine cinematography and the leading lady, who actually did a decent job with a bad material (well, at some moments). For all the rest... Better to forget.\n",

Policeman James Brolin (who is awful) is hot on the trail. It's funny to watch this car just appear, do its thing, and drive off. Where does it go? Where did it come from? Is there a driver? The script never addresses these issues. And the worst part is the script doesn't play fair. In some scenes the car appears to be supernatural as it disappears in front of our eyes. But in other scenes, such as when a woman throws a tree limb at it, the car appears hopelessly natural and real. <br /><br />So if you want to watch a really bad thriller with some decent actors (including Ronny Cox and John Marley) embarrassing themselves then get some popcorn, sit back, relax, and prepare to either laugh your head off or be properly disgusted at the cheap product on the screen.\n",

So i was looking around at the video covers in the videostore when suddenly my attention get caught by the cover of 'Invasion X' (the italian choosen name for this movie). Well, in the high corner on the left of the videotape the first name written was Mickey Rourke. I was glad, finally something new with Mickey was available.

If this isn't enough this movie is also boring and not scaring at all. What i really can't understand is why a director (in this case Allardice) that can have Mickey Rourke in a movie use him so few and just in a scene (it's unbelievable and no-one can understand a choice like this).

Also the Mexican Culture and ways of life in the Mexican city also adds to the supposed plot.Some of the scenes was not needed (atleast to me) because they really dint add any value to the movie other than extending by a few minutes.Mascos looked good,Ana looked hot,Marcos's wife looked seriously obese and the marching soldiers looked fit and trimmed. I also saw a interview of Carlos and Ana which was taken after the Cannes shock treatment.He said he wanted to show real images and thats the reason he prefers débutantes in every movie.Also Marcos is supposedly a driver for his dad at the History of Cultural museum (that obviously explains his inclusion). Well the story could have been much deeper and plot a bit more refined. But its Carlos story so the verdict on this is definitely not very impressive.Still I like some shots of Mexico and the hot girl Ana.. 4/10....If you can watch it .. but don't worry if you have missed it.\n",

            "SPOILERS AHEAD ...The late film director, Aristride Massaccesi had more pseudonyms than I can even begin to remember. One of his most famous was `Joe D'Amato', beneath which he produced numerous sexploitation films, mostly starring Laura Gemser (Black Emmannuel) followed by a string of gruesome horrors, the first of which was The Erotic Nights of the Living Dead.<br /><br />Antropophagous: The Beast remains banned in the UK today as being liable to deprave and corrupt. In all honesty, it is just a gruesome, one-man zombie film. A family are shipwrecked and, in order to survive, the father suggest eating the offspring. Not very pleased with this idea, his wife throws herself onto his fishing knife. He eats them both and by the time the dinghy arrives at a Greek island he has become a cannibalistic maniac, butchering and eating all those who get in his way; definitely worthy of the name, The Beast.<br /><br />A group of travelers arrive on the island only to find it abandoned. That's one hell of an appetite the Beast has. He chows down on the group until only two remain. He's about to murder one when the other comes along and kills him with a pitchfork. Refusing to die with an empty stomach, the Beast decides to munch upon his spilt intestines before he falls to the ground, dead.<br /><br />The gore highlights include A) one chap who is so enraptured in his own walkman (check out those headphones) that he fails to notice the Beast creeping up on him until a hatchet is planted in his skull; B) another chap has his throat torn out by the Beast's ferocious bight; C) a severed head turns up in a bucket of sea water; and D) Zora Kerova (Cannibal Ferox & New York Ripper) has her throat sliced. Don't let Antropophagous: The Beast's reputation, plus these gory factors fool you though. In its entirety the film can occasionally be quite tedious. The music, cinematography and script really aren't much to brag about so certain horror fanatics may feel disappointed with the film.<br /><br />I intentionally left out the infamous baby fetus-eating scene from the aforementioned gore list. Why? Because this is probably the reason the film is banned over here. During this incredible scene the film takes a huge leap down the ladder of taste to a far more disgusting level. I, for one, lost control of my jaw when I initially saw this. It isn't that gory but the idea of such an act, which thankfully was never repeated in another film, still has the potential to disturb.<br /><br />Worthy of its cult following, if you're into this sort of thing. A lot of people preferred the sequel, Absurd (AKA The Monster Hunter) which more an Italian version of Halloween than a sequel to this standing-by-itself horror movie. Whatever you do, avoid the Madusa release of Absurd cause it's cut to pieces. Go for the uncut Monster Hunter version.\n",

            "I remember this Peanuts movie-special, along with A Boy Named Charlie Brown, fondly as a kid, when they replayed these specials on Nickelodeon (or it might have been Disney's channel, can't remember which). Each one had several songs in each pot, all of them catchy to one degree or another, and featuring some of the genuine wit of the comic strips. This film is maybe relying on more sentimentality than the former, as in this one the issue of leaving home and belonging to an master/owner (and the attachment), and the comedy isn't as rampant as in other Peanuts specials. But of the dozens of Peanuts specials- and the short-lived television series- this is one of the better ones, as there are some moments that still stick in my mind many years after seeing it. One of these is the classic \"No Dog's Allowed\" song, with the perfect bass sounding voice. And the whole sequence where Snoopy is under protest taken in by a very determined little girl is brilliantly done for laughs. For some kids, depending on if they're attached to the Peanuts or not, may feel stronger with this film, with the very conflicting climax with Snoopy and his masters. There's enough fun though, as Woodstock's first appearance in the Peanuts series is well placed and delivered, with as many vaudevillian expressions as Snoopy.<br /><br />Just good, family fun for all.\n",

I wasn't a Superman-fan before this. I thought it was something for little boys. But when I saw \"Lois and Clark\", I realized it wasn't at all just for little boys. The excitement, the romance, was also meant for an older audience. <br /><br />I have not seen all episodes, because I did not watch it when Charmed was on TV. I think I started watching somewhere in the second season, but I think it's a pity I didn't see it before.<br /><br />The actors are great - I have read that Dean Cain preferred being Clark. If so, it's hardly noticed(by me)! I used to think Superman and Clark were played by two different actors. This shows how good the disguise was... Although I do think Lois has been quite stupid, not noticing that whenever Superman turned up, Clark was gone. But, of course, that was part of the whole story.<br /><br />The chemistry between Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher is amazing. Superman is the hero, but he never acted as though he was more important than anyone else. In the beginning, when you just see Superman and Clark, you might think Superman is arrogant, but when you know him better, he's not at all arrogant. Clark seems a softy in the beginning, but also when you get to know him better, he's different. <br /><br />Martha and Jonathan Kent seem the perfect parents. They are understanding and independent, which shows how good their actors are.

The battle scenes at the start are artfully, sparingly, and convincingly drawn. <br /><br />Winstanley himself may come off as a bit saintly, but he's nonetheless compelling, and a good choice for the role (he was a schoolteacher by trade and amateur actor). The attention to historical detail borders on the fanatical, and is well worth watching. And much of the dialogue is drawn from actual writings of Winstanley himself.\n",

            "Can't understand all the negative press this film has got over the years. It deserves way more praise than a lot of Universal's more overrated films(e.g. THE WOLF MAN). Chaney is fine in the lead role, and I must say I prefer him to John Carradine in the 2 \"HOUSE OF...\" films. For me, he's far more sinister and threatening than Carradine's \"louche aristocratic seducer\" version.<br /><br />4 reasons why this film is great:<br /><br />1. The sets. The steaming swamps and the shadowy interiors combine to create a rich Gothic landscape and atmosphere. This film is undoubtedly a hokey piece of nonsense, but it nonetheless has a flair for creating a pungent sense of the supernatural and a dark romanticism.<br /><br />2. Louise Allbritton. She steals the film from everyone, and is a deliciously sinister vamp with an agenda that provides this film with interesting plot development.<br /><br />3. J.Edward Blomberg. He plays Prof.Laszlo, an excellent \"Van Helsing\" type. Something of a shame that he's not given more to do.<br /><br />4. The special effects. The best of their kind in any Universal film of the 1940's. There's a really beautiful moment when Drac's coffin rises from the swamp, and the man himself materialises from misty vapour, then floats across towards Allbritton, who awaits her husband-to-be on the bank. Why didn't more of its contemporaries have the visual invention of this movie?<br /><br />In brief then, this film is a lot of fun, and one which I always revisit with pleasure. If you don't like the old Universal horrors then you probably will not like this. However, this is superior work from a studio that consistently delighted audiences with its monster mashes in the 30's and 40's.\n",

            "This is a film built entirely for fans of Shakespeare. If you want a truly cinematic version, try the Brando version. This version is as true to Shakespeare as any film I have seen. John Gielgud in his second Julius Caesar film role, this time as Caesar himself, is studied and brilliant. Brutus plays off of Antony well as the weaker of the generals. Surprisingly, Heston plays a brilliant Antony, strong and resilient, as Antony should be played, and showing a serious command of the language and supernatural world of Shakespeare's Caesar. I recommend this film for any true reader or scholar of Shakespeare as the definitive Julius Caesar film adaptation. If you want Hollywood-type entertainment, go for the earlier but flashier Brando version.\n",

            "An truly outstanding, compulsive drama based on a true story concerning charismatic would-be poet Peter Coyote (in a career best performance) and his manipulation of just about everyone he comes into contact with, eventually leading to murder. This is a fascinating, intriguing telling of a rather bizarre murder case with not only Coyote on top form, but also matched by Robert Loggia as his exceedingly odd, certainly unhinged partner-in-crime. Just watch those final moments in the court-room as he completely loses it and incriminates himself. Wonderful stuff! There are also some very fine supporting performances, not least Peter Boyle's turn as one of the investigating detectives.<br /><br />This is really what made for TV movies do best and I would recommend this without hesitation. Once you begin watching, you'll be hooked!<br /><br />\n",

            "This was set off the basic thematic elements of Lynch's oeuvre. Psychosubconscious horror imagery involving blood, sex, and rich textures of malaise. What's different about this is that it actually goes further, into a child's realm of disturbing imagery, which can be even more disturbing because thinking of Lynch dealing with children is kind of appalling--The Straight Story aside.<br /><br />I think it's probably my favorite short of his, though, considering that it so well mixes everything in animation, stop motion, and real motion, and that overall it's quite adept at forcing you to think about all those children's shows that involve alphabet songs and alphabet animations dancing around, and how a lot of that stuff can be very disconcerting and bizarre if really looked at.<br /><br />Furthermore, I believe it's probably one of his best uses of sound. Lynch is a genius at making sound affect imagery beyond levels that most directors use, and while the sound in this short are much more self-conscious and much more apparent than the underlying growling of most of his work, it's a lot more effective.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB\n",

            "With this warm and uplifting film, the effect Kurosawa achieves is in the simplicity. The story is threadbare. Two lovebirds try to spend a Sunday together in post-war Tokyo and enjoy themselves with only 35 yen in their pockets. Kurosawa never ceases to amaze me because of his incredibly acute comprehension of the visual effects of a story. The simpler the story is, the more it becomes simply a day in their lives. The more it becomes a day in the life, the more upsetting we find the challenges facing them because of the Occupation and the crumbling economy at the time.<br /><br />It's almost like a lightweight version of The Lost Weekend. There are no debilitating problems like alcoholism or writer's block. There are just obstructions and inconveniences with which the characters can either roll or stew around.<br /><br />One Wonderful Sunday is a beautiful slice of life from a time that could be many different times in many different places. It's a peaceful movie about the peace that is always there for a given person, their journey being to find it. I have rarely seen a sequence so beautifully crafted on film as the two lovers in the empty, decaying concrete exterior auditorium, where one resolves to create the music they have been struggling to hear. There is hardly a handful of filmmakers living today that would think of such a thing. Kurosawa may have had the clearest, purest understanding of cinema out of any filmmaker.\n",

Ed Harris's character is sincere and attentive which matches Melanie's softness (which at the best of times can spoil her on screen performances) perfectly.

            "Steven Spielberg's \"Hook\" is one of his far-less loved films, and even Spielberg admitted he was disappointed with the final result. This is quite understandable: \"Hook\" begins as a great movie, but ends only as a good one. I looked forward to it: Robin Williams, my favourite actor, in a Steven Spielberg (my favourite director) film? Bring it on, said I! Let's throw clichés out the window for once. This is essentially a movie geared towards kids, so clichés are rightfully ignored. The movie asks the question: What if Peter Pan grew up? This has never been done before, and this is why the movie stands out: it isn't afraid to explore the unexplored.<br /><br />Robin Williams is perfectly cast as \"Peter Banning\" (who we all know, of course, is the grown-up Peter Pan). Bob Hoskins is positively brilliant as Mr. Smee, Captain Hook's right-hand man. He provides a lot of comic relief, which is fun to watch. Dustin Hoffman himself is a great Captain Hook. Hook is not a purely evil villain in this film, though. He is a comic villain, funny in a goofy kind of way (proof that \"Hook\" is aimed towards the kiddies more than anything). But Tinker Bell is poorly played by Julia Roberts, who played the character with an attitude, and unenthusiastically, and you can easily tell.<br /><br />The first, say, 25 minutes of \"Hook\" are brilliant: Williams is a workaholic who has no time for his kids, when they are kidnapped by the villainous Cap'n Hook. Granny Wendy (Maggie Smith) tries convincing him he is Peter Pan, and later that night, he is visited by Tinker Bell, who takes him to Neverland. This is when the movie stops being amazing, and becomes just \"good\".<br /><br />For once, I found a reason to criticize Spielberg's direction. He made a horrible directing choice when showing the first (non-bird's-eye view)shot of Neverland. I was expecting a breathtaking, sweeping, panoramic first view of Neverland (which is lush and green in my imagination). Instead, there was a confused muddle of an establishing shot. People, buildings, and ships are cluttered so close together, Neverland is revealed for what it is: nothing more than a movie set on a sound-stage.<br /><br />Another criticism I have is about The Lost Boys: none of them are very good actors at all. (This is not to say they're terrible, but they're quite amateurish.) And one of them is alarmingly obese, so much so that later on in the film, his body doubles as a boulder for bowling pirates over.<br /><br />And finally, the fight sequences are poorly choreographed, and the fencing is dull, nothing more than shuffle-thrust-shuffle-thrust, over and over again. Williams and Hoffman may be smashing actors, but they are probably poor fencers, to have their routines limited to such simple moves.<br /><br />One more thought: as with nearly every Spielberg movie, John Williams composed the music for \"Hook\". I'm a big fan of Williams' work, and looking back on the movie, his score was the absolutely brilliant highlight of the film. If you're going to watch Hook for anything, watch it for the music. Williams integrates his music marvellously with what is going on, and the music itself is beautiful: melodic, fun to listen to, and pleasing. His opulent and recurring theme for Captain Hook is one of those tunes that get stuck in your head and refuse to leavebut not in a bad way.<br /><br />In general, \"Hook\" is entertaining. However, it is one of Spielberg's more flawed movies. So why the 10/10? Maybe because this is a film that I truly enjoyed, even though its flaws stuck out a mile when I started writing the review. After all, what's wrong with a little dumb fun now and then?\n",

            "The personnel in The Arrangement reminds me of the LA Lakers basketball team ( around the time this film was made) when they had Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West and Elgin Baylor on the same squad. There were great expectations for a team with three superstars but they never jelled as a unit and were a dismal failure overall. Such is the case with Elia Kazan's The Arrangement, a crashing, sloppy out of touch melodrama of marital infidelity and despair.<br /><br />It would be hard to surpass the ten year run that Elia Kazan had a as film director from 1947-57. Just about everything he directed turned to gold and those that didn't then (Boomerang, Panic in the Streets, Face in the Crowd) have that respect today. In the early 60s he was still producing quality work (Splendor in the Grass, America,America) when he turned to writing a best seller (The Arrangement) eventually bringing it to the screen in the late sixties. Kazan, an actor's director if their ever was one and who translated the words and feelings of John Steinbeck and Tennessee Williams to film so well seemed to be at a loss with his own work and his ability to coax well measured performances out of his cast. Kirk Douglas, Deborah Kerr and Faye Dunaway are uniformly shrill from start to finish moping from one scene to another, making it hard to believe they could feel tenderness for anything. The scenes between Douglas and his mistress (Dunaway) lack intimacy and warmth, their passion forced. With his wife (Kerr) there is total detachment and not even a hint of why they got together in the first place. Kerr for her part seems like she's still in rehearsal. Lacking both sincerity and push she is badly miscast. Richard Boone as Eddie's overbearing old man adds to the disaster with complete over the top bombast, making a lot of noise and saying nothing that brings incite to the role.<br /><br />Having failed at what he does best (directing actors) Kazan goes on to embarrass himself further by employing some of the latest techniques (including Batman pop art) to be au courant in this heady era of American film but in his hands he fumbles. Even the highly regarded cinematographer, John Surtees flounders with sloppy camera movement and uninspired compositions. It's as if everyone attached to the making of the Arrangement suffered from talent amnesia. Kazan had certainly lost his touch and The Arrangement in one full swoop symbolized that decline. As a film director he had nothing left in the tank.\n",

Although I find Zac Efron to be one of the hottest (if not the hottest) man on the planet, his perfect body and alluring charm did not even captivate me enough to keep my eyes open. From an equestrian's point of view, this movie was also terrible. The fact that it's impossible for someone to become a steeplechaser in several weeks makes the plot completely fallible (I've been riding for 7+ years and I am no where near ready, and I compete at 3'). Not to mention the plot already was completely predictable. But whatever. Apparently if you are a really hot, oppressed teenage boy whose parents want you to be a \"real\" athlete and play baseball, you can get on a horse (after falling more times than is really necessary, the horse was already trained and it was rearing/bucking? Come on. A horse does not need to gain \"trust\" necessarily for you to sit on its back), be jumping cross rails in a week (over and over, might I add, which proved absolutely nothing), and be steeple chasing in a few months. If you don't know what steeple chasing is, it's basically a race, but you jump. So a race with X amount of horses all jumping the same things at the same time going speeds that regular racehorses are at. Pretty much racing only 100x more dangerous. And it's definitely not Zac Efron jumping, obviously, since none of the camera angles are of his whole body during the entire race scene. Oh, and guess who wins?\n",

I found the film a little painful to watch. If I had another DVD on the coffee table I would have ended this one early.<br /><br />If you had to look for good things about this movie you can find a few. The actress paying Supergirl was very good. She really came across as a teenager with super powers  a little awkward at times, not always very self-assured. She was really good and had great schoolgirl good looks.<br /><br />However, it ends there. The dialog was strained. The story drug on, almost endlessly, with lack of action. The special effects were terrible even by 1984 standards (I often felt like I was watching the old Batman TV show). Someone else commented that they thought Faye Dunnaway was good. Sorry, I have to disagree. I felt the villains were just average, everyday, bad people  not the scheming, diabolical, evil but fascinating, super-villains typical in DC comics.<br /><br />If you want a good super-hero movie you need a great villain and a riveting plot that moves at a fast pace. You won't find that here. If someone would have warned me off seeing this they would have done me a favor. Hopefully I am doing that for you.\n",

            "Adapted from Algis Budrys excellent short story \"The Master of the Hounds,\" TO KILL A CLOWN is an oddity of revenge cinema from the early 70s. While it serviceably handles the man vs. man with dogs scenario, it unfortunately never achieves full audience involvement due to unsympathetic leads.<br /><br />Despite being based on a short story, the material here is still painfully underdeveloped with major dramatic portions of the story left untouched. Director George Bloomfield has altered Budrys' source story by making Alda's character a Vietnam vet (in the short story he was a WWII POW) and the young couple hippies. This dynamic of the war monger vs. the peaceniks should have offered some interesting social commentary but Bloomfield does nothing with it. It also doesn't help that our hero Timothy (Lamberts) is a really annoying hippie prone to acting like a immature child and talking about his career path as a clown (another variation from the story and source for the odd title).<br /><br />Bloomfield was also obviously inspired by the previous year's STRAW DOGS and more interested in making a film like that. Not only is his lead Lamberts a dead ringer for Dustin Hoffman from that film, but Bloomfield changes the end of the story (where the crippled Major and his dogs invade the couple's house via underground tunnels) to outside assault that segues into a fistfight where the peaceful become the punishers. But Bloomfield is no Peckinpah and the end result is not as powerful as it could be.<br /><br />If CLOWN does have any merit, it is for the pre-M*A*S*H performance of Alan Alda as the deranged Vietnam vet. At first he is subtilely creepy with his awkward questions and affable laugh but as the film progresses he becomes more unhinged. The scenes where orders Timothy around like a soldier are very creepy and by the end he is just a notch below raving lunatic (his speech about how buttons are the foundation of America is a keeper). In fact, all of the acting in this is good with fine turns by Danner (who looks so much like her daughter that it is creepy) and Lamberts despite the bad characters they are saddled with. The two Doberman Pinschers are also quite good and deliver all of their lines perfectly.\n",

            "Plan 9 From Outer Space by the notorious filmmaker Ed Wood was so bad it was good, a laugh a-minute because it was intended to be serious. Sure, the acting was atrocious, and some of the sets were hysterical, but that's what makes it so unbelievably hilarious even today. \"Walk Like a Man\" can't hold a candle to the film-making wizardry that is Plan 9 From Outer Space. The wannabe comedic antics appear like they were written by a seven-year-old who overdosed on Ovalteen or a college freshman who took one too many hits of Metamucil on a Saturday night! The result is a movie that is supposed to be comedy that instead of making you laugh makes you cringe as every pathetic line that tries to be funny is outdone by an even more pathetic line. I mean, just when you think the movie can't get any worse, it passes all expectation by becoming even more unbelievably stupid by the minute.<br /><br />The relatively impressive cast of Christopher Lloyd and Cloris Leachman. cannot save this bottom of the barrel embarrassment masquerading as a movie. I've seen first graders write stuff more clever than this. The \"lines\" of dialog, which seem more akin to banter at a college fraternity party than a written script are just about as bad as they come. The writers must have worked very hard to come up with the worst jokes and cliché lines that Hollywood has ever attempted. <br /><br />The only thing more ridiculous than the movie itself is the premise. A family strikes it rich in the gold country, and as they are driving their sled through the snow back to civilization, they \"accidentally\" lose their youngest son! Well, it looks like he's pushed off the sled by his older brother so he can have more of the gold they discovered! Twenty-eight years later, the brother, nicknamed Bobo, is discovered by an animal scientist among a pack of wolves, but he doesn't act as much like a wolf as the filmmakers want you to believe. Actually wolves have a certain reserved dignity about them. The guy who thinks he's a wolf really isn't acting like a wolf at all, more like a deranged bull dog who scratches himself in funny parts of his body, if he's not licking new acquaintances on their chins. I don't buy that the wolves would have accepted this guy either! I think the wolves took one look at him and went, \"Get this creep out of here!\"<br /><br />Christopher Lloyd plays, or maybe barely animates, the brother (the one who pushed him off the sled 28 years earlier) who is a cross between Scrooge and Atilla the Hun. He has tons of money from the inheritance of the gold, we presume, and this slothful impetuous monster is hated by everyone. He makes Bertie Wooster (of Jeeves and Wooster) appear like an intellectual saint. Not even his mother, Cloris Leachman, shows much love but rather appears to be on the verge of either slipping into a coma, or becoming a cat, a fate not unlike her \"wolfish\" grandchild! Instead of taking care of herself, she dotes on her kitties! The plot revolves around whether or not the \"canine\" brother can inherit his part of the money, or else stay like a, er, \"wolf\", I guess. Or is he more like a dog who thinks he's a wolf? Or is it the other way around?<br /><br />When Bobo finally \"comes home\" and starts licking Christopher Lloyd's face off, it became clear to me that the projector lights may be on but nobody's home. Or maybe this \"movie\" is a few screwballs short of a funny farm. On \"Sneak Previews\", the original show featuring film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, they always had a \"dog of the week\", usually a film so outrageously embarrassing that it earned a quick loving remark at the end of the show. This movie gets my vote for the dog of the century, in more ways than one.\n",

            "This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen (the first 20 min of). When the movie started I thought \"well OK this it just one of those teenage comedy flicks with sexy teenage babes in\" so an OK way to waste some time. After the first 10 minutes I was like \"well OK they just need to get some action started and then the movie will be worth watching\" and then after 15 the first action scene came, and what a load of crap that was. There ware no close-ups of the sexy babes shooting big guns, half of the time the action was stopped because someone had to say something stupid and the whole thing was full of errors and stupid crap. So after seeing the first action scene (app. 20 into the movie) I ripped out the DVD and almost through it in the trash can.<br /><br />To anyone considering this movie \"DON'T RENT IT AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD NEVER EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING IT\"\n",

            "John Huston's adaptation of Malcom Lowry's celebrated novel is very much like his adaptation of Flannery O'Connor's \"Wise Blood\": foggy, dreamlike and at times unwatchable. Huston finds a strange, distant tone that is somewhere between ironic and completely bizarre, with intentionality that is questionable at best. Even though Huston was getting old at this point, he was still tackling challenging material in his old age, which possibly explains the odd mix of provocative, dense material with stilted, unintuitive storytelling. If his age isn't the main culprit for the film's weird failings, then it may be his stiflingly traditional film-making, which seemed a bit outmoded in 1984. Either way, the film never finds a proper stylistic center, causing \"Under the Volcano\" to continually sink into incoherence.<br /><br />Huston's most grave misstep was his choice to pace the film with mostly static shots and slow editing rhythms. For being so conservatively made, there is an almost constant lack of clarity, as no one element in the film complements the other. Albert Finney's go-for-broke performance as British diplomat Geoffery Firmin is fearless and raw, but Huston's shot selections and mostly bland mise-en-scene distract from the brimming anger and pain the actor tries so nakedly to express. Similarly, the absorbing, mythical imagery of the story's Mexican \"Day of the Dead\" setting instead feels random as the foregrounded symbolism seems ham-fisted where it should have been atmospheric. Instead of casting the story's eerie spell, Huston's film-making suffocates the material, causing it to become overblown yet underdeveloped.<br /><br />That is all not to say Huston is completely to blame, however. Screenwriter Guy Gallo's task of condensing such enormous, literary ideas into a stand alone two-hour film is admirable, and structurally he does great things to keep the story immediately revolving around Geoffory's character arc, but by the end it feels like too many corners were cut to make it happen. The character of Hugh, Geoffery's dashing half-brother, is extremely undeveloped to the point of feeling unnecessary, and Yvonne, Geoffery's estranged wife, is never given the psychological need that would make her sympathy toward him credible. Even worse, the conclusion comes with a clumsy thud, ending the film suddenly and untidily.<br /><br />(2 out of 4)\n",

            "While he did not direct it, but rather, only wrote a screen adaptation of his own play, this overlooked slapstick film from 1972 is one of Woody Allen's finest treasures. Back in the day when Woody was just as slapstick as he was verbal, \"Play It Again, Sam\" tells the story of Allen as a divorced film critic crushed by the failure of his marriage. A huge fan of Humphrey Bogart, Allen soon looks to an imaginary incarnation of Bogie to guide his fearful (and clumsy) voyage back into the single life. He is aided by his best friend Dick and his wife Linda (Woody regulars Tony Roberts and Diane Keaton), who assist him in setting up one disastrous date after another. Soon enough, Woody discovers that sometimes you actually find true love but it doesn't always work out the way you wish.<br /><br />Personally, I don't care too much for the whole Bogart-as-mentor thing. I spend most of the film cracking up at Woody's clumsy gestures and neurotic nay-sayings. As usual in an Allen film, Keaton gives a sweet, self-effacing performance. Because the film was directed by Herbert Ross, the typical rambling dialogue and back-and-forth editing is toned down a bit, so for an Allen vehicle, the movie feels more mannered and has more of a narrative strength than Woody's other wacky 70's productions. Still, Woody has never made me laugh harder - ever.\n",

            "We've all had problems with our jobs, but how a job can relate to relationship problems is something else. In \"Career Opportunities\", they develop that to an interesting degree. In this case, janitor Frank Whaley and popular girl Jennifer Connelly accidentally get locked in a department store overnight, and thus have to reassess their lives (especially when some thugs break in).<br /><br />Knowing that John Hughes was involved in this movie, we may expect it to be another \"Breakfast Club\" or \"Home Alone\". \"Career Opportunities\" is far superior to either of those. More than an excuse to look cool or cute, this movie dissects the characters' lives: he's the guy who no one ever thought could make something of himself, she's the pampered teenager primed for a world of excesses. And it's up to them how they deal with this sticky situation.<br /><br />Anyway, this isn't a masterpiece, but I still recommend it. Also starring Dermor Mulroney, and John Candy in a bit part.\n",

            "There's nothing special or significant about Glass Trap that hasn't been done about a thousand times before in these types of B-grade Sci-Fi movies. A large metropolitan office building is gradually overcome by gigantic radioactive ants who trap the helpless maintenance workers and office staff. Things get really bizarre when a SWAT team is called in to blow up the over-sized bugs. The project seems to play out like a funny RAID bug-spray commercial from the 70's! However, the corny situations and stupid dialog make this movie mildly entertaining. I am a fan of B-grade movies that bring back 1950's-1960's low budget special effects. Glass Trap makes an honest effort at doing that. It's not a good film by any means, and certainly the talented Stella Stevens is completely wasted in this. You will recognize some actors such as C. Thomas Howell as the janitor, and Martin Kove as a law enforcement official. Howell, best known for his role in The Hitcher, and for Kove, playing the sadistic karate school instructor in The Karate Kid.<br /><br />There is just enough amusement in Glass Trap to keep it from being a bomb. The pacing is faster than you might expect. One mild spoiler, is that I thought the photo shoot scenes were completely stupid and unnecessary. As another reviewer commented, it appears that these scenes were almost part of another movie, because they didn't fit at all! With the acting as bad as it is in this film, viewers might just want to cheer for the ants! Go into this film with the mindset of it being a B-grade horror flick and you'll find it an acceptable late late show movie. However, Glass Trap is certainly nothing more than that.\n",

            "When I first saw this movie I was like 3 or 4 years, and I thought of it as one of the greatest adventures in the world. But after a short while I realized there are many sad parts in it, especially the good bye party. I'm 21 now, and I'm still watching this movie over and over. I found out that no other cartoon has as beautiful loving parts filled with love as this one, but on the other side it is one of the most negative cartoons I've ever seen. <br /><br />Remember, right at the beginning Charlie Brown cuts his hand and is yelling at Snoopy. The other day Snoopy is very drastically fighting with Linus over a blanket(?). Next he goes boxing with with Lucy, ends up with a shoe in his face. Then we see as Lila is in the hospital, very sad music under it. Then Snoopy is thrown out of the beach because of the NO DOGS ALLOWED sign. He runs away from home to see Lila and meets this little girl who wants to keep Snoopy and Woodstock. Turns out to be a freak and beats Snoopy because of the tea SHE spills out on his dress. After they try to run away she takes Snoopy to the Vet where by sounds we can assume some pretty bad things happening. Meanwhile Charlie Brown is really sad. Snoopy gets to the hospital after a journey full of NO DOGS ALLOWED signs. Snoopy is hesitating with whom to stay Lila or Charlie. Snoopy goes home to say good-bye to his friends which is the saddest part in the movie. Snoopy goes to Lila and while leaving his Doghouse with the \"For sale or to let\" sign on it Woodstock runs after him crying while we can hear this really sad song in the background which later Charlie Brown is singing in his deep depression. This is the last sad part in the movie thank God, because when I'm watching it I cant manage to watch the whole movie with dry eyes. <br /><br />Thus the movie has VERY beautiful and happy and lovely parts in it. One of my favorite parts is when Peppermint Patty and Charlie Brown are at the amusement park and are talking about love and Charlie touches Patty's hand.<br /><br />This movie has marked my life for a lifetime positively and negatively. When I'm sad I just think of how Snoopy begins to laugh in the library. No wonder I always get upset when see somebody kick someone in the leg like Snoopy did to Linus,etc.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to everyone because its beautiful, but warn children with weaker soul( I just cant find the right expression), because it can leave serious marks in a child's life. You can never get enough of this movie.Its brilliant Its beautiful yet very disturbing.\n",

            "A group of obnoxious high schoolers are on their way to a concert when they find that their car is running low on gas. The driver, dweeby, pimple-faced Drew(Ryan Hulshof)also gets the gang lost, having missed the highway leading them into hicksville, where a sinister farmhouse and massive barn reside on a country road. Clownish Zach(Brian Austin Jr), his fraidy-cat(..the kind afraid of her own shadow)constantly complaining girl-friend Justine(Lindsay Dell), annoying immature jock Josh(Eric Phillion), and high school hottie Taylor(Jenna Scott)find themselves looking for Drew when he leaves to find a possible fuel pump nearby the farmhouse never returning. As they search through the farmhouse and barn, they encounter a backwoods psycho whose face is hidden by long messy black hair, quietly awaiting each victim before attacking from behind when they are most vulnerable. Those who are able to get away, head for help and a phone trying to stay one step ahead of the predator.<br /><br />Obvious Texas Chainsaw Massacre clone lacks any tension whatsoever. Despite some eerie locations such as the abandoned farmhouse falling to waste and ruin, a barn still equipped with livestock and hay, and a slaughterhouse up the road from the main setting of the film, there should be an abundance of atmosphere. But, it seems instead of building dread, director Al Randall builds boredom as his cast spend 85 minutes of the film searching for either each other, a phone, or assistance. Walking, walking, and walking some more, these characters are always looking with little action taking place. The violence on display is lacking as one victim sticks his hand in the blade of farming equipment(dumbass)attempting to prove that no one is among them, one victim is stabbed with a screwdriver, and another is knocked unconscious by falling hay. Jenna Scott as \"final girl\" Taylor, is very attractive eye candy, certainly nice to look at for 90 minutes, often seen pulling off her shirt with the director establishing just how developed she is under her bra, has no personality whatsoever. She's merely on screen, constantly keeping her hair out of her face, belly exposed after scissoring her shirt early in the movie. Taylor's confrontation with the killer during their final showdown is numbingly ineffective, devoid of tension. The killer spends a lot of time off-screen as the two girls run around trying to find a phone, easy prey yet the predator seems little inspired to catch them. When he does trap the two girls in the slaughterhouse, he moves so slow and gives his quarry plenty of time to fight back. Just a terrible climax following a tiresome 80 or so minutes of wasted time.\n",

            "Tibetan Buddhist teacher Robert Thurman writes in Inner Revolution: \"In karmic evolution, the successful actions that lead to positive evolutionary mutations such as a human life are those of generosity, morality, tolerance, enterprise, concentration, and intelligence. Their opposites - stinginess, injustice, anger, laziness, distraction, and ignorance - are unsuccessful actions, which lead to negative evolutionary mutations that take you down the chain through animal incarnations.\" We got to thinking about this when we realized that the mutants in the sci-fi thriller X-Men are of two types: the generous, moral, and intelligent ones, and the animal-like ones acting out of revenge and anger. The message is clear: evolution can go toward the good or the bad, and there will always be a battle between the two possibilities.<br /><br />X-Men, with stories revolving around the activities of a group of mutant superheroes, has been a phenomenally successful franchise for Marvel Comics. Now director Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects) and screenplay writer David Hayter have adapted this series for the screen. The movie exposes the battle going on for America's soul. In doing so, it goes right to the heart of the country's shadow - our continuing inability to deal with those who are different from us, either by race, ethnic heritage, sexual preference, or generation. The story taps into the reservoir of feelings we have about diversity, tolerance, and exclusivity. And, let's admit it, all of us, at one time or another, have felt like a mutant outsider different from the \"norms\" of society and cut off from the \"in\" crowd.<br /><br />U.S. Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) has a cause. There are mutants living in American communities, and nobody knows how and where they might use their strange and strong powers. He wants to protect human citizens by passing legislation to require them to register with the government. Indeed, even mutants with the best intentions can't always control their impact on others. When Rogue (Anna Paquin), a Mississippi teenager kisses her boyfriend for the first time, he ends up in a coma for three weeks. She can absorb the energy and memories of anyone she touches.<br /><br />Fleeing to Alaska, Rogue meets Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), another mutant who has amazing healing powers, which come in handy when his retractable adamantium claws inadvertently inflict damage. These two \"freaks\" as the locals call them eventually team up and find their way to Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the world's most potent telepath who has started a school for \"gifted students\" - a.k.a. mutants. His key assistants are Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who has telekinetic and telepathic skills, Cyclops (James Marsden) whose eyes release energy blasts, and Storm (Halle Berry) who can manipulate weather disturbances.<br /><br />Not only must these X-Men fight the forces of bigotry and repression afoot in America, they must square off against Magneto (Ian McKellen), a mutant who has survived the Holocaust and now believes that a war with the humans is inevitable. He concocts a plan to turn the world's leaders into mutants at a special U.N. gathering on Ellis Island. The X-Men come to the rescue and must contend with his evil team consisting of Sabretooth (Tyler Mane), a beast-like warrior; Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), a metamorph; and Toad (Ray Park), a high-jumping monster with a ten-foot tongue.<br /><br />Thanks to its thematic riches, X-Men is far more interesting than the Batman superhero flicks. Most fascinating is the love/hate relationship between the peaceful Professor Xavier and the power-hungry Magneto. In the last scene of the film, they play a game of chess in a prison holding Magneto. We all know that the mutant villain has not made his last move.<br /><br />\n",

            "Oh, horrid film, where did you go wrong? I hope I have enough fingers to count the ways. There is a point during film-making when a director or producer can simply say \"Stop\". There is no harm in that, nor is there any shame. This should have been one of those films that somebody, anybody, should have said, \"we need to stop now\". From the uninteresting characters, to the lackluster story, to the very poor production, the lines between avant-garde horror cinema and cheaply made movies became hazy.<br /><br />There are three ways to completely destroy the power of a film without touching the story and those are through sound, sight, and mind. If a movie sounds great, you have captured some of your audience. If it looks good as well, you have captured even more and finally, if you can keep them mentally involved than you, as a director, should have most to all of the audience in your hands. Sadly, 13 Seconds did none of the above. The sound was horrendous. Synchronizing your actor's voices to match what they were saying when filming and the emotions they were feeling is not hard. Apparently, director Jeff Thomas decided robots could make this English spoken poorly dubbed in English feature. There was no emotion behind anyone talking, even our main character Davis. I found myself laughing whenever anyone opened their mouth. I couldn't tell if anyone was actually interested in what was happening, or if the amount of beer drinking that occurred before the dubbing was finally taking effect. Second, the sight of this film was just as bad as the voices. No apparent acting classes were needed from any of the actors or from the demons. There needs to be some level of class with the both the actors and demons, but in this film there were not. Davis, Jeff Thomas, was trying hard to be exactly like Bruce Campbell, which only lowered this film further into the pit of disgust. Everyone else seemed like they were going through the actions that were given to them that minute and trying to remember what exactly they were doing. There were no genuine moments in this film visually, just non-actors remembering to be robots. Finally, the mental involvement is key. I am not talking about just story here, because you can have a bad story but still keep people guessing for more. I am talking about just the apparent want to see what happens. Does your audience want to see what is going to happen next? In this film, my answer would be \"no\". The ending does provide a moment of shock, but you need to force your way through an hour and a half of sludge just to see it  and it really isn't that grandiose.<br /><br />With these three elements lacking considerably, you may be thinking what is the value of this film? I was amazed to see that it had won some awards in the horror circuit because, to me, it showed the poorest of the poor. While I would agree, that the ending (without giving it away) was creative and inventive, what filmmakers need to realize that you need to have a complete film to blow us away. Do not just pride yourself on the ending because you are going to have upset people like myself that could tell that you spent more on that then you did the rest of the film. I have heard other critics say that this is like a low-budget The Sixth Sense, but for me it was not even in the same ballpark. Half the fun of The Sixth Sense was the action leading up to the surprising ending (which wasn't even that shocking), and that is where 13 Seconds suffers. Thomas' film has nothing to offer in the middle except for a very muddled story in which you nearly need a PhD in pagan culture to fully understand. I think I would have been more impressed by the ending of this film if there was a meaty center instead of all that gristle and grime.<br /><br />Was this the worst film I have seen this year? After a day of thinking about it I can say \"no\", but would I be truthful to myself? There were some interesting scenes, which did showcase some of Thomas' potential, but the blatant disrespect for everything else just hurt those good points. I had trouble coping with the voices and the constant clichés that Thomas tried to repetitively use. There just seemed to be too much running into rooms and shadows lurking in the darkness instead of character development and understanding. I needed to know who these people were and a better explanation of the immediate story. Thomas seemed and felt unfocused in this film giving us not enough in one area, while completely destroying another. Inconsistency is what hurt this film, but what destroyed it for me were the small bits that could have easily been changed to construct a decent film. I wasn't happy, and I don't think many will be with the final results that 13 Seconds has to offer.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****\n",

            "Unlike most of the reviewers of this particular movie, I'm really not the much of a Cynthia Rothrock fan, to say the least. However when I saw that the movie had Fred Williamson and Robert Forster (both great actors), I just had to watch the film. Williamson is a Dakota Smith, an alcoholic cop who is demoted to scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush and even worse having to team up with Cynthia at the behest of the captain (Robert Forster). Forster is always watchable, it's just a crying shame that the movie itself is so damn trite and clichéd. It also features one of the least terrifying villains ever to be committed to celluloid. Williamson would return to the Dakota character in a few more films, the next one being \"Down N Dirty\" <br /><br />Eye Candy: Nina Richardson shows some T&A; Mary Kapper goes topless <br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />Where I saw it: Showtime Extreme\n",

            "This movie was terribly done, although Paul Giamatti did well in his performance it was not enough to save this film. I watched this movie in a theater packed with other people all excited about this film, however after its showing, more than half were at the box office demanding their money back. We pay money to be entertained in theaters, many were not entertained and therefore received rain-check vouchers. Bottom line,... go rent Sixth Sense.<br /><br />This movie was a tall order to swallow. Shyamalan has let all of his followers down and really has failed the viewing community this time. Please like I said go rent something else or watch Clerks 2!!!!!\n",

            "This picture takes some considerable constitution to watch, to endure.<br /><br />Se7en is not a nice film.<br /><br />The sets and locations are dark, gritty, grimy, nasty and bleak. There are no bright hues, nothing flashy or rosy to welcome the viewer.<br /><br />What grabs us first(perhaps) are the very real homes of Det. Mills and Det. Sommerset. There are sound effects of the police sirens passing by. There are the muffled sounds of neighbours through the walls. There is the ticking of various clocks.<br /><br />This looks a lot like 'real' life.<br /><br />It's quite hard for me to put a lot of this into words. The investigation, after the subsequent finding of the first victim takes Mills and Sommerset, and the film viewer into a dark, seedy world where the crimes performed by the 'killer' are inspired by the seven deadly sins. It's important, I feel to view se7en from time to time, simply to make us feel better about our own life. The score and the sound effects fit the dirty, nasty unforgiving feel of the film. You arn't sure if it's John Doe that is the enemy or the world outside. I'm sure as I type in the safety of my own home somebody somewhere is committing an unspeakable crime. Maybe they will be caught. Maybe they won't.<br /><br />The acting very good from the main characters, and solid from the lessors. The interesting part of me is looking at how Mills and Sommerset work as a team, being of an entirely different nature. Sommerset is calm, collected, intellectual, elloquent, subtle and wise. Sommerset is like a sniffer dog released from the pound after a long and tedious stay. Grumpy, intolerant, verbally unrefined, impatient, yet with a good heart.<br /><br />All of the crimes shown strike cords within us. Some more horrific than others; all thought provoking and psychologically challenging. Just how *do* you continue to eat, completely full and unable to swallow another mouthfull . .only there is a gun to your head and the trigger will end your life it you stop .. <br /><br />It's hard to recommend this one to anyone. Film fans i.e those who appreciate a well made movie will be on the edge or their seat come the building chase. Others will look on in partial disgust, partial intrigue as the camera shows the horrific detail of John Doe's methodical skills.<br /><br />What un-nerves me, is to think that out there there is a John Doe out here. He's not count Dracula, he's not Jack the ripper. He is a normal man, perhaps enjoying a simple life. We might see him in the food market or the pharmacy. We might see him and acknowledge him, or we might not. That individual has a darker plan in his mind that you or I or any *good* people could conceive of, and we won't know until something happens. <br /><br />There are no apologies and no compromises. This is a brilliant, bleak, horrific and psychologically damaging look at the darker side of human nature. Highly recommended for those of a mature mindset.\n",

Columbo should never do another film, his pouty face and supposed sadness over the death of his father is a hilarious \"gem\" to watch. I've seen high school plays with more drama than this. Baldwin, at least seems to be laughing at himself in his role which makes it easier to see him as the lothario that his family is famed for. Let's see what else, plot....um yeah....don't even bother listening it will save you from having to make up alternate scenarios in your head. I mean who wrote this script!! I'm angry at even having rented and spent time watching it. The ancient warriors were wholly unnecessary and take up literally about 8 minutes of the entire movie.

            "One must make allowances -- it was wartime, it was propaganda, it was United Artists -- but even taking all that into account, this is a fairly ludicrous melodrama about an upper-middle-class American household that brings chaos on itself by unknowingly inviting a Hitler Youth into its home. And what a little hellraiser he turns out to be -- writing anti-Semitic epithets about his teacher and potential stepmom (Field), whacking his cousin(Carroll) with a fireplace iron, attempting to knife a playmate. Adapted by no less than Ring Lardner Jr. from a hit Broadway play, it may have had resonance at the time, if audiences were willing to overlook pedestrian direction, absurdly melodramatic music, and Homeier's undisciplined histrionics (reprising his stage role, he's sort of a Nazi Dennis the Menace). But the script, like so many at the time, takes the goodness of Americans, all Americans, so for granted that it starts to sound smug and patronizing. (It's a mighty white-bread America they're portraying, too; if that's how things really were, it looks today like an unwitting expose of America's racist past.) It also suggests that it's fairly easy to deprogram these little monsters; all it takes is a bit of lovingkindness and a birthday present. March and Moorehead (playing a repressed spinster aunt, much like she did in \"The Magnificent Ambersons\") were as good as movie actors get, but they're playing devices here, not flesh and blood. Under the circumstances, Betty Field manages to be surprisingly interesting -- she always looks so worried, like she has a horrible secret the audience never finds out.\n",

            "My Take: How could such a decent cast get sucked in to this mess? A boring, so-called \"adventure\" with unintentional laughs.<br /><br />After creating the passable, but at least good-looking, \"King Solomon's Mines (1985), the guys from Cannon Group/Golan-Globus production rushed this low-budget sequel (filmed back-to-back with the original) with the same lead cast, Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone. The results in this sequel that's probably the least interesting adventure picture ever made. It's bad, but actually pretty funny. I can see the first film as a parody of the INDIANA JONES series, but this one just bad because... well, it's bad. Chamberlain and Stone (oh, the horror!) reprise their roles, this time even with an evident boredom. Chamberlain is as uncharismatic as ever, while Stone hams up her performance in ever way possibly. James Earl Jones is decent as an ax-wielding Umslopogaas, but his dialog is just as bad as the other actors. Robert Donner (Who's that guy? I don't know!) is funny, but even he is a disaster. Silva is bad bad (and talk about a bad hair day!). The sets are low-budget (the Lost City of Gold wasn't even that much made of gold), the action sequences are badly staged and the script is pale.<br /><br />But the film is still really funny (mostly unintentional, of course)so I would recommend it to any viewer who is scrunched in a seat with nothing to watch. <br /><br />But if your looking for an old-fashioned adventure romp, even like those in the same league as its predecessor KING SOLOMON'S MINES, your find yourself yawning after the first \"action\" scene unfolds. Ironically, the trailer for promoting this film had more action than the actual film. And the trailer's only 2 minutes! It's short, but sure is better than 99-minutes worth of boredom. <br /><br />Rating: *1/2 out of 5.\n",

            "This simple, profound movie can help change your heart. Without using anything crass, it gives you a message that is gritty and real. Life is about love. You will weep, laugh, and rejoice to see this movie, if your heart and mind are open and not clouded and cluttered by the trash of the overly secular world. The journey the hero takes is one that tests his mettle and often you feel like giving up on him, but seeing how it comes out shows you that prodigals do make it home. I read that this will be Mr. Garner's last film, I do hope that such is not the case, however if it is, then he has gone out on a high note that is a fine cap to his career. I have not read the book, yet I am sure that this is one of the better adaptions of a book to movie. Christian films get a bad rap as being too bland. Many of them are, but not the Ultimate Gift. It is a gift, from the film maker to you, the audience. I hope that seeing this will inspire others to live out the gift and that we see more such movies being made.\n",

            "There's been a lot of yada yada yada about the \"Seinfeld\" curse, so-called, because none of the cast of that beloved show have found successful vehicles since it ended. There are reasons for this. The most obvious is that much of what they've produced has just been crap. Look at Jason Alexander. Aside from the wonderful \"Duckman\" cartoon, his two live action series, \"Bob Patterson\" and the recently canceled \"Listen Up\" (which was unwatchable, formula treacle), were both ratings duds. This is a guy who, on Broadway, was practically George M. Cohan! Same with Michael Richards (Kramer). His lone attempt at solo fame (\"The Michael Richards Show\") was mystifyingly terrible. It seems that all of the \"Seinfeld\" cast have made bad career moves since the show ended. At least, Julia Louis-Dreyfus has tried to be conscientious. She's been in some duds, sure, but her previous attempt, \"Watching Ellie\", was a good show, that just needed a little retooling. The cast was sharp, it was well-written and she was bubbly and easy to watch. The major problem it had, was that it felt like some of the later Laurel and Hardy movies, the plotting was a little trite. I understand she had a lot invested in that program, her husband wrote it, they both produced it. So when the nincompoops at NBC decided they weren't going to give it a fair shot, it must have been a bitter pill to swallow. She's been on hiatus for a few years; I suppose, just to let the smoke clear. Now, she's back with \"The New Adventures Of Old Christine\", and believe me, this one is complete junk. For starters, she looks terrible; wan and sickly, with circles under her eyes and primarily, she plays a punching bag. If Elaine Benis was rife with insecurities, Christine's insecurities are eating her alive. Here's the premise: her husband (a lackluster milquetoast of a man) and her were having marital difficulties, so they went to a therapist, who, we find out, episodes in, is a nasty incompetent who was having sex with the guy. Like everything on this program, the shrink is a broadly drawn cartoon. If this woman were your marriage counselor, you'd be looking for a new one mid-way through your first 45 minutes. But, okay. So, when the series begins, Christine's spouse has already walked out on her, for a younger, NICER woman, who is also named Christine; hence, NEW Christine. Brutal. She's moved into a not so great apartment, has trouble making ends meet, nobody likes her... . I mean, how do the producers think that anybody who's EVER lived through a divorce (what- 75% of the USA now?)could find humor in this? Mostly, Old Christine doesn't even have suitable responses to the group of sharks around her. The supporting cast either doesn't care, doesn't have any use for her or they simply want her gone. None of this is even mildly amusing, let alone witty but worst of all, there's simply nobody to root for. Hamish Linklater, as her odd, clueless, immature brother, is the closest thing here to funny, but his part is written in such a peculiar way, that I wouldn't be surprised if, in a future episode, we all find out he's a serial killer. Her ex-husband is a shadow, her young son is one of these kids who was hired on cute quotient, not ability. The 3 rich, snobby mothers at her son's school are beyond contempt, but compared to Dreyfus' mewling, neurotic, battered, apologetic Christine, I almost feel sorry for them; at least they can stand on their own two feet. This is a show about how a decent woman who's made some mistakes, gets smacked down by life at every conceivable turn. It's painful to watch and it needs to go. As for that \"Seinfeld\" curse, I'm beginning to think it's on us.\n",

Far too much of the humor relies on the audience buying into those wonderful 1950's female stereotypes. I mean, we have female army officers, nurses, acting like silly little girls. It's quite revolting. In other words, far from being a classic, the film feels like an unintelligent, unenlightened piece of pop trash. Compare this to another Cary Grant film that came out the same year, North by Northwest; or Tony Curtis's Some Like it Hot which also came out in 1959. On an intellectual and artistic level, Operation Petticoat doesn't begin to come close.\n",

From it's appealing opening scenes, one might expect something of 'Mean Streets'' calibre (Cassavetes came up with the idea with the help of Scorsese, it turns out).

            "James Ponsoldt is an impressive new talent whose gifts are well displayed in this very excellent small film, OFF THE BLACK. Ponsoldt is that rare combination of writer/director who has something unusual and significant to say and has the skills to tell his story with genuine sensitivity and with amazingly polished skill for one so new on the scene.<br /><br />In a small town anywhere in the US aging alcoholic Ray Cook (Nick Nolte) lives alone, spends his time making videotapes of himself in conversation with his son from whom he has been separated for years. He also is the umpire for the local baseball team, the pitcher for whom is a teenage lad Dave Tibbel (Trevor Morgan), a boy whose mother deserted her family leaving Dave and his younger sister Ashley (Sonia Feigelson) in the care of functionless distant father (Timothy Hutton), a man who would rather avoid any conversation or emotional support with his confused kids. Dave and two friends visit Ray Cook's house one night, empty trash on his lawn, scratch graffiti on his driveway and throw toilet paper streaming from the tree and TV antennae. Ray is sober enough to catch one of them - Dave - and makes a pact with the boy that he will not call the cops if Dave promises to clean up Ray's cluttered yard.<br /><br />Dave keeps his promise and gradually Ray and Dave warm to each other, each finding in the other the desperate needs to fill their empty lives - a 'son' and a 'father'. Ray convinces Dave to pose as his son at his high school reunion and the results of that experience coupled with numerous other incidents bond the two in one of the more tender love relationships ever captured on film. No, this film is not about physical attraction: it is about the kind of love that is a basic need in each of us and one that sadly is lacking in so very many lives today.<br /><br />Nick Nolte delivers a superb performance and it is refreshing to see him once again prove that he is a fine character actor. Trevor Morgan (at age 20!) is a revelation, that kind of actor who apparently excels in his craft intuitively. The supporting cast is likewise first class and the musical score by Claire Campbell, Alex Neville, and Brian Petway fits the film like a glove. Tim Orr's cinematography is so attuned to the story that it feels like the camera is another character. OFF THE BLACK is yet another little Indie film that came in under the radar and deserves so much greater an audience than it has had. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp\n",

            "I knew nothing about this film called OUTSOURCED. I had never heard of it. I was just channel surfing at our home in our village and happened to stumble upon the listing for this movie on the programme schedule. The synopsis sounded interesting. An American whose job has been outsourced to India coming to India to train his replacement. I thought, another culture-clash film. I was quite right, though. Plus, I was informed that the film starred one of my favourite actors, Ayesha Dharker, who is playing the lead opposite Josh Hamilton who I just faintly remember as the handsome young man from Ismail Merchant's 'The Proprietor'. I found Josh Hamilton good-looking and I've always loved to see Ayesha Dharker and, honestly, I had nothing good to do that afternoon, so, I sat down to watch OUTSOURCED and enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />OUTSOURCED shows India in all her exotic splendour  there is Ganesh, Kali, the Shiva Lingam, the ubiquitous Bollywood number, Holi celebrations, cows on the road, juicy mangoes, even a garishly decorated hotel suite called the Kama Sutra suite  but nowhere does it present India as a poor, backward or a Third World country. The film starts with the power of India. Quite flattering. We see a whole bunch of Americans losing their jobs because their jobs have been outsourced to India. Then, there is this disgruntled American, Todd (Josh Hamilton), who is being sent to India by his boss Dave so that he could train the new recruits on American society, culture and accent and tell them how much important those cheese-shaped hats are to them. \"Kitschy\", he calls them.<br /><br />The fun begins the moment our hero lands at the Mumbai airport. He misses the driver who had been sent to pick him up because that poor fellow was holding a placard that said \"Mr. Toad\" instead of \"Mr. Todd\". And so poor \"Toad\" has to travel on an auto-rickshaw, then by the local train (which he was trying to board with all the western civility, brandishing his ticket, but has to come down to the Indian method of jumping randomly into any compartment when he sees that there is no space), and then over the potholed and cow-filled roads of the real India. He eats a \"barf ka gola\" and encounters another very Indian problem. No change. Because of this he has to pay a one-hundred-rupee note just for one ice lolly. We Indians would have somehow managed to find a few ten-rupee notes.<br /><br />Then, there is this guy he has to train. The stars-and-stripes-in-his-eyes guy, Puro (Asif Basra), who thinks his fiancée is more beautiful than Aishwarya Rai. Of course, Mr. Puro, too, calls our hero \"Mr. Toad\". \"Mr. Toad\" has to teach Puro how to make \"small talk\". First, he has to explain to Puro the meaning of \"small talk\", \"kitsch\", and the like. Then, \"Mr. Toad\" puts up with aunty ji (Sudha Shivpuri, 'Ba' of 'Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi') who tells our hero that eating with the left hand is \"unclean\". Her errands-man then demonstrates to a shocked \"Toad\" why eating with the left hand is unclean in a scene which had me rolling in laughter. Aunty ji cleans, starches and irons \"Mr. Toad\"'s underwear because that is what all Indian mothers do.<br /><br />\"Mr. Toad\" has a bout of diarrhoea, is shocked to see a cow walking into his office; learns of the power of Goddess Kali; comes to know the meaning of Shiva Lingam; plays Holi; has his mobile phone stolen and returned and stolen again and returned again; dances to the \"Sajan ji ghar aaye\" song from 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'; befriends a man from the dhobi ghaT; dresses up in a kurta; eats a ripe mango the Indian way, by peeling it with teeth and sucking on the pulp; does a very typically Indian \"jugaad\" (which is the Indian art of very economically managing big things with the least resources) of electricity with his friend from the dhobi ghat when his office is flooded and lines are down; and falls in love with the stunning and smart call centre employee, Asha (Ayesha Dharker), who opens his eyes to why the Indians and our English is superior to that of the Americans. Because, our pronunciation is better  accurate, in fact  and we pronounce Internet as \"Inter -Net\" and not \"Inner-Net\" the way the Americans do. Sadly, the hero discovers that this smart Indian woman who could have been his true love is already engaged to be married, and he is shocked to learn that she was engaged when she was only four. When he tells her that he found this early engagement stuff very odd, she tells him that she found the nearly 50% divorce rate of the Americans odd. Smart.<br /><br />I realise I have revealed too much about this film, but that was unavoidable. I liked every second of this film. Every second means each second. The scenes, the sets, the dialogues, there is nothing which seems exaggerated. The end of the film, too, is very positive. The film starts with a laugh and ends with a smile and I sat till the end credits ended. I liked OUTSOURCED that much. The story, the direction, the acting, the soundtrack, everything is just right. OUTSOURCED is a great film. Just watch it.<br /><br />P.S. I noticed that the producer of this film is Tom Gorai. Now, Gorai is a common surname in eastern India. I was wondering if Mr. Gorai was an NRI and if this is a film with some Indian connection. I later did some Wikipedia research on Tom Gorai and learnt that Mr. Gorai is an American. OUTSOURCED is a complete American work on outsourcing and India and the US. And it is a very funny and quite sensitive film. This, I believe, is its real strength. Watch it. Watch it.\n",

They include Vin Diesel as a popular extreme sports star drafted by the U.S. government to become a secret agent and infiltrate a crime ring. ???ughhh A hard core surfer played by Sean Penn sells his home so he can trek through the Central American underworld in search of his best friend, a fellow surfer named Captain Zero ??? ugggh NOW THIS. I am not a major skateboarding fan but good Hollywood please leave this sport alone if they are going to churn out crap like this. PLEASE I saw the movie for free at a screening and still want a refund!\n",

            "Sorry but this could have been a good film, the acting was very good, but who wrote the awful script? There was just far too much bad language and I turned the DVD off half way through. I am no prude but does anyone really use the F word THAT much? If so they need help! I was really looking forward to this film because of the good reviews and the fact it was about Salsa ( having Jennifer Lopez to look at doesn't hurt either ) but it really was spoiled. I know that I am probably alone in this but for me constant bad language just grates and it spoils my enjoyment of any film. Some swearing can be justified but it got worse as the film went on. Surely there were better ways to show the decline of a man into drugs than that? For me it is sloppy scriptwriting and even sloppier direction of what could have been a really good biopic.\n",

            "After dating a wonderful man, Hope (Nadja Brand) comes back home, sees her daughter Jennifer and goes to sleep. She wakes-up in the woods with a psychopath (Eric Colvin), fighting to survive for more than forty days and asking information about her daughter to the stranger.<br /><br />\"Broken\" is a sick, unpleasant and disturbing low budget movie. In spite of having a reference in the beginning of the movie that it is based on a true event, the pointless story is completely flawed, the character of Hope is a total idiot and the schoolgirl is very stupid and annoying. There is no explanation about where they are and how the women have been kidnapped and transported to the middle of nowhere; Hope is an imbecile, and I do not understand how her character does not kill the sadistic maniac when she has the chance and after being tortured the way she had been; the schoolgirl screaming all the time is really irritating, provoking the nasty situation with her tongue. I did not like this gross movie. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"Jogos Sangrentos\" (\"Bloody Games\")\n",

            "You might need the help of a bottle of rum to make it through this overwrought, overly long, sanitized pirate saga.<br /><br />This film should have been and could have been exciting with some major tweaking. Bad casting was a large part of it's problem.<br /><br />For starters, I would have made Blackbeard the central male character of the film, and he would have had a romance with the heroine.<br /><br />I would have had Blackbeard played by a young, exciting actor - such as Naveen Andrews. Instead, Blackbeard, whose beard by the way, was rather odd looking, being so long and narrow, was played by Angus Macfadyen.<br /><br />Mr. Macfadyen is a middle-aged man who is fighting a middle-age spread and who looked as if he belonged in an recliner chair in front of a TV set far more than he belonged on a pirate ship.<br /><br />The male lead, Robert Maynard, was played by Mark Umbers. He was all right, but not handsome or exciting enough.<br /><br />And while I greatly admired the heroine, Charlotte's spunk (Jessica Chastain),she was no shrinking violet - the woman didn't hesitate to use a gun or a knife - she was so homely, she could have stopped a clock at midnight on a moonless night.<br /><br />There was scenery chewing aplenty, along with a lot of action on the high seas, and no doubt quite a bit of historical inaccuracy. Certainly more than a bit of unrealistic happenings.<br /><br />They go in search of Captain Kidd's treasure - find it - and then I'll be darned if they don't go in search of it again. That part was completely murky. Did Captain Kidd have more than one hidden treasure? Was the first one Captain Kidd's and the second one some other treasure? I don't know and I didn't even care enough to try to figure it out.<br /><br />4 stars out of 10.\n",

            "This film is about a middle aged woman, Melba May (Park Overall,) who has big dreams, but is going nowhere. She lives in a trailer, in Nevada, with her husband Flint (Don Harvey.) One night Melba catches Flint with another woman, and leaves him. She decides to go to Vegas to meet up with an old friend from high school, Dottie Delgato (Veronica Cartwright,) who's dreams went where she wanted them. But when Melba finds her, she finds out Dottie's dreams only lasted temporarily.<br /><br />Back at home, Flint gets a knock on his door, finding out that Melba just won a million dollars. But only Melba can expect it. So Flint goes off to find her, basically to kidnap her, so he can keep the money himself. It was only possible for Melba to get to Vegas by three young agents from Hollywood, off to Vegas to make money. This movie is an okay movie. I'd give it a 7/10, only because I didn't expect much from it. It's better as a movie made for TV.\n",

            "This is one of the best horror flicks any one in their right mind could endure. Its lower than low budget and is a masterpiece of both no budget and expliotation cinema. The actors are amazing with some coming out of retirement to act in this. Sitting in his wheelchair the amazing Dr Frankenstien outsmarts a very scary and very black Dracula! The scene is amazing, Dracula is invited into the home but that crafty Dr has placed a mirror on the roof so he can see (or not see) Draculas reflection!! When Dracula realises he has been tricked the 'oh f*uck' look on his face is pure acting genius!!! There are many scenes of joy but to list them would be to destroy a film that you have not seen.<br /><br />\"When a man comes into my house and casts no reflection.....\" What a scene!!!!!! Listen to all the Dr's lines in the film, you can hear his dentures clackin around!!!! This is an amazing decision by the director and gives the feeling of unease and terror one would expect from a production of this calibre perfectly.!!! A must see!!!!\n",

            "I own a VHS copy of this film and have watched it several times and it never ceases to be delightful. Some of the other reviews are no doubt hampered by being the result of a single viewing or not paying attention. For example, at least two identify Shirey Temple's character as a college student rather than a high schooler.<br /><br />To understand the interpersonal dynamics of the story, let's start with two of the great supporting actors in this film Rudy Vallee and Ray Collins. Collins plays a psychiatrist who does consulting work for the criminal justice system and who wants to see his niece, a police court judge played by Myrna Loy, married. Vallee plays an assistant district attorney (ADA) who is romantically interested in Loy's character but is frustrated by her lack of interest and Collins' overt hostility. Between her career and caring for her teenage sister played by Temple, Loy is content to spar with Vallee but keeps him at arms length.<br /><br />For those who are having trouble with the \"lady judge\" in the 1940s angle - there were a few especially as lots of young male lawyers had gone off to the war and left opportunities for women in legal careers as in other fields, Loy plays a minor court judge, and she has relatives in the system (the aforementioned uncle and another who seems to be a retired judge). One also needs to know the times to understand that \"bobby-soxer\" refers to young girls wearing sox with the tops turned down (\"bobbed\" which means shortened). Another historical note - at least one reviewer has mentioned that there is a hint of pedophilia in the relationship between the characters played by Temple and Grant (mild by comparison to The Major And The Minor with Ray Milland and Ginger Rogers pretending to be 12). This is a somewhat anachronistic view as the trend has been toward raising the legal age of consent and the age for marriage in the two generations that separate us from the time this film was made. The idea of the high school girl and the playboy artist dating or marrying would have been a bit scandalous in a middle class milieu like this, but it would not necessarily have seemed criminal to most folks.<br /><br />So now we come to the silly schoolgirl crush which Shirley Temple's character conceives with regard to the urbane, sophisticated, handsome, and slightly rakish artist played by Cary Grant. This is a stock element of many romantic comedies. In fact, there is an interesting parallel between Shirley daydreaming that Cary Grant is a knight in shining armor and the romantic reveries of Reese Witherspoon's character in The Importance of Being Earnest. Our teen heroine in this movie is a bit of what we would now call a \"drama queen.\" We see this not only in her relation to the older artist, but in the way she returns to her high school beau talking about how handsome he will be in uniform (he just got his draft notice).<br /><br />When our psychiatrist uncle (Collins) comes up with the idea of having the artist (Grant) pay court to the bobby-soxer (Temple) till she tires of him, he is playing a double - even a triple - game. He wants to put what he considers a real man (Grant) in close proximity to the judge (Loy) and he wants to irritate the assistant district attorney (Vallee) whom he expects will suffer by the comparison.<br /><br />The artist accepts his unusual form of probation reluctantly and soon begins to see another, and more desirable, side of the judge but each time they begin to get close something intrudes to keep them from acknowledging their feelings. Meanwhile, the artist craftily cultivates the friendship of the ex-boyfriend to keep him in our bobby-soxer's company.<br /><br />The scene at the community picnic where the artist and the ADA compete (sack races and such) for ribbons, and the attention of the judge, is hilarious, especially as our bobby-soxer bribes the high school boys to help her artist to beat the ADA. And the later scene in the nightclub is also a real winner.<br /><br />The chemistry between Grant and Loy here is not the greatest, Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House is much better in that department, but they give a good account of themselves as reluctant lovers. Loy was always fabulous as the straight partner for a physical comic actor which she perfected in over a dozen pairings with William Powell (I Love You Again, Love Crazy, the Thin Man series, etc.). Through most of this film Grant has little scope for his physical comedy (especially as compared to Bringing Up Baby or Monkey Business) which is why the picnic sequence really shines, but his facial expressions and voice make the most of the limited possibilities, especially in the nightclub scene where there is a lot going on in a small space and Cary Grant still shines.<br /><br />This movie is a bit dated, and I don't think you could make it today with the same charm and innocence. But it is a joy to watch on its own terms and I highly recommend it.\n",

            "What can I say but OH MY GODS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had heard rumors about this movie's extremities (no pun intended) and that it was much more...ahem...wild than the t.v. show. Now, I've only seen a handful of the television shows, and they're pretty racy and raunchy, but I've always liked what I've seen. It's definitely not a show (or movie!) for kids. Or the faint of heart, or the easily offended. But then again, if you know that you're an easily offended person DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE! <br /><br />I loved this movie. Granted, I have to admit that I was shocked and surprised through 95% of it. But it was great nonetheless. It was funny and vulgar and said pretty much everything in a manner that was NOT politically correct. But then again, aren't we all getting pretty sick of political correctness?<br /><br />I think one of the things that gets most of us, (at least myself) is that when we were kids that age, we never would have gone around saying half of what those kids did. Or, if we did, we did our best not to get caught! Of course, I was only ever threatened with getting my mouth washed out with soap...not my mother starting a war with a foreign country! <br /><br />The musical numbers were great! They were very upbeat and will stick in the minds of viewers for years to come. In the future, when we're all sitting behind our desks (or whatever jobs we may have), we'll notice that we'll be humming certain catchy tunes and when we stop to wonder what it is, we'll remember the songs from South Park both with humor and with horror that we're actually humming them out in the \"civilized\" world. The scene I think the best for musical numbers was where several of the different songs were going on at one time. It was very \"Les Miserables\" like (I saw the musical so I know what I'm talking about) in a very sick and twisted sort of way. It was simply funny and light hearted.<br /><br />This movie poked fun at just about everything in the book. Nothing was spared. Not Christianity, not different racial stereotypes, and certainly not the gay community. But none of it was handled in a fashion to be hateful or humiliating. In my opinion, all the jabs were meant to get people to see that there shouldn't be the divisions that there are and when people get separated, they leave themselves open to ridicule and criticism. Rather if we all came together and put aside the divisions and stereotypes, then perhaps we could all see the humor in remarks and jabs like the ones made in this movie. <br /><br />As for the political statement: it's true, you know. This country (as are many others) is always looking for something or someone else to blame for all the \"troubles.\" We as a nation are hypersensitive to every little thing and just about everything is taboo. From swearing to being able to purchase certain adult oriented \"toys,\" a person can't do anything in this country without being censored or \"forbidden\" to. It's sad when a state's laws or a person's hysteria keeps people from their constitutional right of free speech and the like. And this is what this movie was trying to point out. I agree with the person who is his review of this movie wrote, \"They're just words\" about the swearing in the movie. And that's all they are. <br /><br />I give this movie a 10 for its humor, its musical numbers and its obvious statements. I think that everyone (who has an open mind) should go see this movie...and then go again and take someone who doesn't have an open mind so that it can be opened by the hilarious things said and done in this movie.\n",

            "A film about ultra-privileged young contemporary Manhattanites romanticising themselves in the doomed spirit of Scott Fitzgerald may sound unbearable, especially as this is a very talky movie. But 'Metropolitan' is actually quite delightful, in fact because of the very quality of the dialogue - the characters are elegant show-offs, which gives the writer the freedom to indulge them with clever lines. And clever in both senses - the characters are themselves clever, but the writing is cleverer, as the protagonists inadvertently give themselves and their absurdities away in spite of their intelligence. However much you may want to hate these people, it's simply a delight to hear them talk. In fact, my main criticism is that the screenplay falls too much in love with its own creations - as it reveals the failings and absurdities of the characters, it starts to forgive them, which is probably more than they deserve. A final kick at the end to remind us (and them) of the nature of real life might have made this great, as opposed to merely good.\n",

Not everyone will understand the finer points of some of the humor, but the hilarious voice-overs and the practice of recycling scenes are undeniably funny. The climactic fight scene is great fun, with plenty of poorly-executed slapstick and general ridiculousness. Ninja Bachelor Party is a joke all the way through, including the credits. At half an hour long, you can't afford not to try it out.<br /><br />Just don't expect to take much away from this film... not recommended for mature audiences.\n",

            "SPOILERS<br /><br />Yes, yes, I know this is not a Holiday show, let alone movie, but I really wanted to comment on it. This show is created by who else than Matt Groening, who obviously created the Simpsons. Although it may not be as good as the Simpsons it is still a fantastic comedic cartoon. The characters in Futurama also have overbites like the characters in the Simpsons. The characters are not yellow, though. As you know by now, Futurama takes place in the future, so there are robots, aliens, one-eyed aliens that look like regular humans, people from Mars that look like regular people, one hundred sixty year old men, and much, much more. The future contains tubes that suck people to places, booths that can kill you, and hover cars. <br /><br />A pizza delivery boy named Fry who goes out to deliver pizza. It is almost the year 2000. At the place where he is supposed to deliver the pizza he falls into a freezer. He is frozen. One thousand years go by. It is the year 3000. When he thaws out he is flabbergasted at what he sees. He learns that his nephew Professor Farnsworth lives close by. He meets a robot named Bender. All he does is drink and smoke cigars. He meets Leela, a one-eyed alien that looks like a regular human. She chases him to make him get his delivery job. He finds Farnsworth. Bender, Leela, and Fry become delivery people, alien, and robot. Fry also meets Amy, Hermes, and Dr. Zoidberg. All of them go on zany adventures.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic cartoon. Although it may not be as good, it's still great. I never found this show to be as funny as the Simpsons, though. I mean, there's laugh-out-loud moments, but just no as much as the Simpsons had. I also found some endings to Futurama are incredibly sad and depressing. Some of the endings include the ending to Jurassic Bark, when a flashback shows that Fry's dog in the past had waited next to the pizza parlour for Fry to return for the rest of his life. I mean, it's so sad, the dog had waited for him. The dog's eyes were so sad and hopeful. Also the end in Time Keeps on Slipping was really depressing. Anyway, this is a great show.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />Recommended Titles: The Simpsons.\n",

            "The Cremaster Cycle 9/10<br /><br />The Cremaster Cycle is a series of five films shot over eight years. Although they can be seen individually, the best experience is seeing them all together (like Wagner's Ring Cycle) - and also researching as much as you can beforehand. To give you an idea of the magnitude, it has been suggested that their fulfilment confirms creator Matthew Barney as the most important American artist of his generation (New York Times Magazine).<br /><br />The Cremaster films are works of art in the sense that the critical faculties you use whilst watching them are ones you might more normally use in, say, the Tate Modern, than in an art house cinema. They are entirely made up of symbols, have only the slimmest of linear plots, and experiencing them leaves you with a sense of awe, of more questions and inspirations than closed-book answers. The imagery is at once grotesque, beautiful, challenging, puzzling and stupendous. Any review can only hope to touch on the significance of such an event, but a few clues might be of interest, so for what it's worth ...<br /><br />Starting with the title. The 'Cremaster' is a muscle that acts to retract the testes. This keeps the testes warm and protected from injury. (If you keep this in mind as you view the piece it will be easier to find other clues and make sense of the myriad allusions to anatomical development, sexual differentiation, and the period of embryonic sexual development - including the period when the outcome is still unknown. The films, which can be viewed in any order (though chronologically is probably better than numerically) range from Cremaster 1 (most 'ascended' or undifferentiated state) to Cremaster 5 (most 'descended'). The official Cremaster website contains helpful synopses.)<br /><br />Cremaster 1 features four air hostesses in each of two identical cabins, centrepieces sculpted from vaseline on respectively green and red grapes. An androgynous looking woman beneath each works a hole in the tablecloth and plucks grapes which direct choreographed patterns of dancing chorus girls. This seems to suggest the splitting and multiplying cells of a still androgynous gonadal system.<br /><br />The Guggenheim Museum (which houses a parallel exhibition) describes the Cremaster Cycle as \"a self-enclosed aesthetic system consisting of five feature-length films that explore processes of creation.\" As film, the Cremaster Cycle is one to experience in the cinema if you have the opportunity to do so, or to experience and re-experience at leisure on DVD (the boxed set is promised for late 2004 and will be a gem for lovers of art-cinema fusion).\n",

            "STRAY DOG stands as the legendary Akira Kurosawa's first real masterpiece, noteworthy for at least two big reasons: the style - classic American film noir (rich, velvety b&w atmospheres), enhanced with a touch of Italian neo-realism (great use of diverse locations, which provide a great view of day-to-day postwar Japan), and the star, a young Toshiro Mifune, whose truly collaborative association with Kurosawa was cemented here, and would grow in spectacular fashion during the subsequent 16 years. <br /><br />Mifune became as much of an international icon as Kurosawa, and this is the first film where it's easily evident why. As an example of film noir, STRAY DOG offers plenty of gripping suspense and moral complexity, and holds up well alongside classics like THE BIG HEAT, THE KILLING or THE MALTESE FALCON. Kurosawa touched upon international influences to an unprecedented degree in Japanese film (the internationalist impulses of Ozu, Kenji Mizoguchi or Mikio Naruse are just as deep and varied, but far more discreetly deployed), Kurosawa also skillfully highlights Japanese specifics (the rookie cop expecting to be fired, even accepting the possibility in an apologetic fashion, only to be assured that he will not be fired - this would not occur in a similar American setting), while always linking the same details to universals: honor, nobility, responsibility. This would become the thread linking Kurosawa's celebrated period/samurai films to his contemporary dramas. STRAY DOG was perhaps the first of his films where it truly resonates in a global fashion - a timeless, classic film.\n",

            "I don't even know where to begin with this wretched excuse for a movie. Two very unlikeable (and hard to look at) women are obsessed with their selfish desires to have the \"perfect\" wedding that they can't even share it with their best friend. In the end, it says \"Don't fight with your friend...they'll give up eventually and let you have your own wedding.\" I can't even stand to look at the poster for this crap. I don't even want to write this review. It's a waste of time. Just like this movie. Only worse. I'd rather cut off my big toes and run from Maine to Mexico non-stop while simultaneously sticking blood-sucking leaches all over my crotch. That's how bad this movie is (if you knew me, you'd know how important my crotch and toes are to me).<br /><br />The utter selfishness of the two lead characters just pisses you off so much that you do hope something bad happens to both of them and when such things (and believe me, not nearly bad enough) happen, you won't laugh. You'll just sneer evilly because that's what you want to happen. Honestly, I was hoping one of them would either kill the other during a childish cat fight or accidentally stepped in front of traffic. Hell, a murder mystery does sound a hell of a lot more interesting anyway.<br /><br />This is going on my list of the worst of 2009. Without a doubt. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must redeem myself for putting my mind through that kind of torture and watch something good.\n",

            "I am writing this as an alternate viewpoint to the praise heaped on this film over these pages. Bottom line, the film is inoffensive, but really not very substantive entertainment-wise or message-wise. It starts with a CGI treatment of a wheat field on the opening credits, which looks distractingly silly. It weakly conveys that the main character (a boy named Evan Taylor) believes he has some kind of control over the field, but it falls short of the intended correlation to his sensation of \"music everywhere\" which is better illustrated later in the film. The story set up is VERY slow and heavy-handed in establishing Evan's beliefs about one day finding his parents. Only half way through the film does there begin to be any appreciable progress with regard to the plot. Sure, things happen to the characters, but nothing really connects the audience to their emotion. <br /><br />On the positive side, Robin Williams appears in this film in a role that is suited for him and that he plays in a restrained and powerful way. His character is the least trite, although you can somewhat \"see him coming\" from the moment he enters. Another highlight is the character of \"Arthur X\" a child musician who basically drives the plot forward all on his own for most of the second act. One senses that this actor Leon G. Thomas is capable of much more than the \"official black ghetto kid\" dialog he is given. Terrence Howard turns in an elegant performance with his portrayal of a caring social worker. Overall, the film doesn't require a *little* imagination or suspension of disbelief, it requires whole re-calibrations of reality from scene to scene. Not that you would think it's true-to-life, but it doesn't even make sense within its own parameters. Lastly, the music is all over the place thematically, stylistically and not cohesively or meaningfully - although there are some great players performing. An interesting concept for a film, but I found nothing to take away from it. If you want to see a feel-good film in this genre done correctly, check out Serendipity.\n",

            "Let's see: I had great expectations towards this film, since Danika pretty much has the potential to be a fairly enjoyable thriller, but to my disappointment, it turned out to be one of those films that deliberately try to be confusing just for kicks. I don't know about the others, but I'd say I had my share of these kinds of psychological thrillers that usually lead to the same disappointing endings and nonsensical sequences. You know, the typical soft-horror/thriller/drama flick in which the main character keeps having hallucinations and visions about horrible things happening around her and the rest of the characters are dead worried but they still don't do anything to help her out. Even though Ariel Vromen succeeds to create a puzzling atmosphere and there are two or three enjoyable moments, I'd say that these 'twist in the end' fever has been pretty much overdone already. This film pretty much offers a nice variety of pointless hallucination sequences in which Marisa Tomei, giving a flawless performance, always repeats the same situations but in different scenarios. Obviously, it ends up getting tedious after a a while. <br /><br />'Danika' is the story of a genuinely desperate housewife, whose main fear is to lose one of her children or the three of them, for that matter. This obsession of overprotecting her kids, turns out to be the result of a traumatic childhood experience, in which poor little Danika loses her brother in a road accident. During the course of the film, the mentally unstable woman, appears basically smothering her children and over-worrying about every little thing, making the rest of her family lose their patience. However, it is clear to Danika that something is definitely not okay with her, as she realizes that she's experiencing weird hallucinations that turn her life into hell on earth.<br /><br />This film offers a few sequences that promise some sort of explanation whatsoever or at least a tiny little connection to the end. Nevertheless, just like many other recent flicks out there with a twist in the end, 'Danika' turned out to be ambiguous for no reason and it tries to deceive the audience and doubt about their own intelligence. My advice is to avoid this film, unless you are bored and you have nothing else to see. I wouldn't label it as 'unwatchable', because that would be unfair, considering that there are a few good things that deserve to be appreciated, but it's mostly Marisa Tomei's performance actually. 'Danika' is not terribly bad, but frankly, I was utterly disappointed when the good atmosphere and the few achievements were suddenly overshadowed by the silly ending. I wouldn't recommend this... sorry.\n",

            "I had the opportunity of seeing this film at the London Film Festival and as I grew up in the 1970s, it seemed like an interesting premise.<br /><br />Sadly, 'Whatever Happened to Harold Smith' is another in a long line of British cinema disasters and is destined to be lambasted by the critics and ignored by the public.<br /><br />The makers of this film are so lazy that they feel that stringing together a bunch of cultural references around a shallow and uninteresting story and adding a big soundtrack is enough for a surefire success. Well, despite the ridiculously sycophantic applause of Saturday night's audience, the release in February or March will illustrate that this is simply not good enough.<br /><br />The performances are passable although Stephen Fry does little more than play himself and the lead actor is so inconsequential that I can barely remember his performance.<br /><br />However, it is the cultural references that really grate - these include a car painted like Starsky and Hutch's, not one but two examples of Hai Karate adverts, a ridiculous take off of the opening of Saturday Night Fever and a variety of newsreaders from the period clearly appearing 20 years too old. It's remarkable that they didn't manage to squeeze spangles in somewhere.<br /><br />However, the single worst thing about this film is the way that it portrays punks as criminals or deadbeats. Having been a disaffected youth into this music myself, I don't recognise these characters at all and this moral line on a little rebellion leaves a very nasty taste indeed.\n",

            "As a romantic comedy, this is a good film. The acting is fairly good - particularly Johnny Lee Miller, who makes an excellent Edmund. But the story is not that of Jane Austen's wonderful novel. The Fanny Price of the novel is a delicate wallflower, intelligent and warm but extremely timid. In the film, she's feisty and strong-willed, independent and almost rebellious. Fanny Price is not confident and witty; she is shy and thoughtful. This \"new\" Fanny may fit modern sensibilities, but I was severely disappointed; by completely altering the main character, the whole story seems different. I should very much like to see an adaptation of the novel that remains as faithful to the book as the BBC's excellent mini-series version of Pride and Prejudice (the Colin Firth / Jennifer Ehle version) or Emma (with Kate Beckinsale, not the Gwynneth Paltrow version). If you want a romantic movie, go for it. But if you're an Austen fan, you might want to stay clear.\n",

            "It's been a weird day. My air conditioner went belly up and I sought refuge from the 100+ degree heat at my local mega-multi-plex, buying a ticket to the \"Bourne movie\". After 20 minutes of that movie's self-conscious unsteady-cam filming technique I was feeling a little queasy and bailed. Stopping at \"Bratz\" to recover my equilibrium before seeking a refund and an airsickness bag. What I saw was a totally empty theater (zero people) just two weeks after the movie's release.<br /><br />I couldn't find much similarity between the teen actresses and the dolls (the dolls are all a lot cuter). What strikes me as interesting is not the content of the movie but the fact that it was given a wide theatrical release. The inventory of films must be pretty low if they have to send this anywhere but direct to video. <br /><br />As already pointed out this is \"the single most shallow, insignificant, poorly-directed, badly- acted movie of this year\", or maybe any year. It also has about the narrowest target audience possible for a mainstream film, 3 to 9 year old girls with an infatuation with clothes, shoes, hair, and make-up. They must be serious girly-girls, your soccer and softball playing daughters won't find anything to relate to here. <br /><br />But I'm not sure if the complaints about the message behind the film are really valid. It revolves around four multi-ethnic BFF teen girls who have nothing in common except their fashion trend value systems. Now this would be bad if the characters were played by beautiful young actresses in a school full of gorgeous likewise beautiful girls with perfect bodies. Which is what you expect from the standard pre-sold teen movie. But instead Yasmin (Natalie Ramos), Jade (Janel Parish), Sasha (Logan Browning), and Chloe (Skyler Shaye) look ready to pledge a dogs, pigs, and elephants sorority. For a while I thought I was watching an episode of \"Animal Planet\". Meredith (Chelsea Staub) was a pleasant exception in this school's bovine to canine parade.<br /><br />They look more like four homely college freshman than hot high school fashion types and the student body looks just as bland. Whatever happened to the days when starlets got parts based strictly on their beauty with their acting skills irrelevant? Of course acting skills were just as irrelevant in these casting choices. Which leads to the obvious question of how a group of people so average looking and so clueless about the thespian profession happened to all wonder onto the set of this movie looking dazed and confused. The point being that no little girl is going to get an inferiority complex or suffer from an eating disorder because of watching this movie. The producers have unintentionally managed the positive message that no amount of expensive clothes, shoes, hair, and make- up can make an average girl look like a hot teen actress.<br /><br />Speaking of wandering on to the set looking dazed and confused, Jon Voight plays Meredith's father and the school principal. Now I realize that the highlight of Voight's recent career is a \"Seinfeld\" cameo and his teeth marks on a pencil, but appearing in this mess is the equivalent of Bela Lugosi working with Ed Wood in the 1950's to support his drug habit.<br /><br />The movie concludes with a loud and irritating musical number which I suspect was inspired by the success of \"High School Musical\". <br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.\n",

It's a minimalist tale of three people--a gypsy girl, a rich woman, and a mysterious man who likes to be in the buff whilst riding his horse--engaged in a three way relationship. The sex scenes are blunt, perfunctory, and frankly quite dull, the characters are one-dimensional and lacking in motivation, and the film's conclusion is almost as ridiculous as its contrived opening sequence. I'm not sure what the other reviewers liked about La Visita del Vicio (titled Sodomia on the Luminous tape), as it bored me to tears. Perhaps not quite as bad as the worst Jesus Franco film, but close.\n",

            "Now isn't my summary awfully confusing?! How can a somewhat dull film STILL be worth seeing? Well, believe it or not, the problem is that the plot isn't all that compelling but the characters are so well-crafted that the film is still outstanding!! Sure, some of them seem an awful lot like stereotypical clichés--especially John Qualen's performance as a Norwegian, by Yimminy!! In fact, he says \"by yimminy\" about 60 times during the film--somewhat typical for a Qualen performance in a Ford film, actually!! But apart from this, there are a lot of great characters such as the Yank (Ward Bond), Drisk (Thomas Mitchell) and Smitty (Ian Hunter). The one person in the film I really DID have trouble categorizing is Ole Olsen (John Wayne). It seems Ole is a Swede and I really had trouble seeing Wayne as a Swede!!! Probably this is because since this film he's become so type-cast. I really don't think his accent was that bad--I just kept waiting for John to shoot an Indian or walk with the usual John Wayne walk, but it wasn't to be.\n",

I watched it, and although the film by itself was only mediocre, there was one aspect, one historic performance that made the movie worth watching, my life worth living.

            "As is obvious in the complex responses to both the book and the film by Errol Morris and Philip Gourevitch, STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE places in our faces some facts we would rather shield than discuss. The story of the period of between September 2003 and February 2004 at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq is so well known not only from the news media but also from the Internet blogging sites that it need not be outlined in a review of this film. The facts documented by photographs taken by those who participated and observed the inhuman treatment of prisoners are indisputable: seeing them on the screen in full frame and in close-up shots is almost more than the compassionate eye can tolerate. But there it is and yes, we do need to witness the abuse and humiliation that describes the US prisoner treatment in Iraq, no matter who is to blame - enlisted personnel, MI, high ranking military officials, the White House. The fact that it occurred as such a gross abuse of human rights should awaken in all of us a more complete awareness that war makes humans do such things. It is ugly to watch, difficult to digest, and extremely trying on our set of beliefs that man's inhumanity to man has and does exist despite our need to believe otherwise. <br /><br />Given the atrocities documented by this film, the style of the film as a work of cinema deserves to be addressed also. The flow of the documentary with the interplay of interview pieces by those infamous young people upon whose shoulders the blame was placed in what appears to be a diversionary technique to avoid deeper probing of the true guilt, along with the images of the prison itself - stark lines of cellblocks and living conditions so foul they seem to actually smell on the screen - is well conceived and beautifully/creatively captured by cinematographers Robert Chappell and Robert Richardson and enhanced by a strangely appropriate musical scoring by Danny Elfman. The film may be about things ugly, but the technique used to tell the story is high quality art. <br /><br />Abu Ghraib, along with Guantanamo, will always be a scar on the conscience of America, even beyond the time that this ugly Iraq war is over. We should all look at this film with the hope that with seeing actual footage of a nightmare may help prevent recurrences in the future. Grady Harp\n",

The film whose trailer I pointed to and said 'that's what film-making has come to these days; all attitude and no heart', turns out to be the most fun and riotous satire I've seen in a long time. \"Shoot Em' Up\"--a relentless, simultaneously energizing and hilarious movie--is a surprisingly smart confection. As conceived by writer-director Mike Davis its an over-the-top send-up of every action film ever made; a wink and a nod (as well as a parody of) to the bloody overkill of \"Die Hard\" and \"Rambo\", the gleeful excitement and charm of \"Indiana Jones\", the cornball abandon of \"James Bond\", the who cares of \"North by Northwest\", the heroic terseness and ease of \"Bourne\", the ultra-stylized and preposterous overdrive of \"The Matrix\" or anything ever made by John Woo (particularly a love for \"Hard-Boiled\"), and even in one scene the splendid lunacy of \"Raising Arizona\".<br /><br />The whole project, through controlled chaos and witty abandon, is made as a single, continuous in-joke. As in most films that take themselves too seriously, Clive Owen's hero (enigmatically titled Mr. Smith) quite literally never stops shooting. He shoots while having sex, he shoots while in the middle of free-fall, he shoots the umbilical cord off of a baby, he shoots with his fingers broken. Davis takes over-the-top to a whole new level; poking fun at action movies by taking their ridiculousness to its brinking point.<br /><br />Everything is done with an intentional preposterousness. For no reason Smith takes the baby of a dead woman (whom he helped deliver...in a frenetic shootout nonetheless) and decides to protect the infant from Paul Giamatti (dropping his nice-guy smugness, and superbly playing his diabolical villain with maniacal glee) and his army of goonish gunmen (why are they even after it?). For no reason, Smith just happens to be the world's greatest gunslinger (he doesn't miss; he doesn't break a sweat...in fact the whole movie Owen plays Smith as the ultimate joke: with a straight face. Same expression for killing, sex, talking, anything).<br /><br />The enigmatic coincidence of it all is only part of the film's joy (and when it begins to explain some its elements, that's where it goes wrong). Mostly its about the cartoonish, endlessly inventive shootouts; each staged with more ludicrous precision than the last. Its both funny and exceptionally filmed; the dialogue another homage to the stupidity of action films (among Smith's witty remarks: \"Eat your vegetables\" he laments after impaling a man with a carrot).<br /><br />And what is an action film without (besides a huge body count; a beautiful woman who does no more than look hot and talk sexy--kudos to Monica Bellucci) quirks for its hero? Smith is all caricature with a few cartoony peeves. For one he hates a lot of things (including bad drivers), but more importantly he has a fondness for carrots (\"they make your eyesight better\" he growls); he even turns them into weapons.<br /><br />\"Shoot Em' Up\" does all that it can to be every kind of action-movie. And it succeeds; staging endless fight after fight in every way imaginable, never repeating itself and quite literally ending with a bang. 9/10 <br /><br />\"I hate ponytails. They don't make you look hip, young or cool\"- Shoot 'Em Up\n",

            "I saw this film several years ago on television here in France and thought it was great. It was so eerie and atmospheric. Jean Simmons was lovely and fetching as young Caroline whose evil Uncle Silas, played superbly by Derrick DeMarney and his unscrupulous cohort Madame Rougierre try to do away with her in a gloomy mansion along with the aid of Silas's son Dudley (Katina Paxinou is brilliant as Madame). Unfortunately, I didn't have a VCR back then and so I couldn't record it. Now that I have gotten a video recorder, the only place that I've found it to be available is over in the States. They only carry the American released version from the early 1950's when Jean Simmons really caught on over there. The films title was changed to \"The Inheritance\" and a scene where Uncle Silas has Dudley propose marriage to Caroline had been cut by the censures (incest was taboo in American cinema back then). Uncle Silas then forces Dudley to leave the house only to sneak him back later in the wee hours of the morning. In the American print we are not sure who that someone is (or why someone is being sneaked back into the house). It would seem confusing if you had never see the uncut British original. Lastly, in the British version Uncle Silas overdoses and dies. For some strange reason, in the American version he kills himself with a self inflicted gun shot wound. If you can get the British one, do. If not, the American release copy is a worthy second. **** out of **** stars. P.S. It's also a great book (\"Uncle Silas\" by J.S.LeFanu) and it's back in print!\n",

            "If you consider yourself a James Bond fan and yet enjoyed this film, there is a problem.<br /><br />Just like everyone else, when I first saw that Daniel Craig was to replace Pierce Brosnan in the role, I was a bit confused. His ice cold looks seemed to be quite a stretch from the image we have of James Bond. Maybe \"they\" know some things I don't about 007, maybe I've been missing something about the character. Plus,the hype around the production was excellent,the rumor was that the filmmakers have decided to be more daring in many aspects. Nothing wrong with that, as a long as you know what you're doing.<br /><br />But at the very first frame of the film,my original skepticism re-emerged:<br /><br />The opening scene happens in a sombre black and white cold war setting in which Bond makes no spectacular entrance, chatting with his enemy and finishing the mission with his fists inside a...dirty public restroom. Then Bond spins around, aiming his gun at the camera, taking the classic pose. Right then, I couldn't help myself but noticing the restroom tiles in the background(!) and this blond muscular hunk in the center of the screen suggesting: \" I am your NEW James Bond!\". \"Not yet,gentlemen\" did I think.<br /><br />Still, let's give them a second chance, here comes the long-awaited opening credits. A beautiful animation of paisley patterns and stylized men fighting in slow-motion,turning into flying hearts,spades,clubs and diamonds at each blow. But something is missing: where are the gorgeous nude feminine silhouettes? Where are the girls? Gone !!! Why???!!! At this point, I feared the worst: did the producers decide purposely to get rid of everything we actually loved about James Bond?! <br /><br />But here comes hope:James Bond chases a man through a building site,climbing on cranes, jumping and falling hard. Great, this might not be a real James Bond flick, but at least, we're in for some good entertainment. Right?<br /><br />Wrong: The rest of the film is nothing but a long (two and a half hours long!)demonstration on how to annihilate a movie landmark character.<br /><br />No Monneypenny,no \"Q\",no \"R\", and every time \"M\" (Judi Drench) appears on the screen, the ONLY thing she ever does is begging Bond to stop doing what he's doing and come back to his senses. Yet,all I could hear from her was: \"What have you done to James Bond? Who are you, blond man?! Why don't you ever smile? Why don't you ever say anything witty? How come the only gadget you use is a cell phone? How dare you wreck THE 1964 Aston Martin in only 3 minutes? How could you fall in love with such a boring girl? What do you want from us? Bring us back England's most precious hero!\"<br /><br />The other characters barely exist: The villain, named Le Chiffre, is a card player who's task is to finance terrorism by playing poker. Does he cheat ? no. Why? He might be a villain, but will not take his cruelty as far as... cheating! We know he's the villain since his left eye bleeds once in a while and he acts like everything is fine. Who knows,maybe someday,we'll get to see a villain who plays Monopoly with a runny nose. So scary.<br /><br />Then I thought: \"I get it! His damaged eye is in fact a technological wonder that allows him to see the other player's cards thanks to the mysterious blond girl, in the background, who's eye is a camera placed surgically inside her head and feeds Le Chiffre with her own vision! Great!\". Was I right ? Of course not, that would be something you'd see in a James Bond film...<br /><br />But here comes the most sacrilegious scene EVER to come out of a James Bond film:<br /><br />James Bond (let's keep using this name, for the lack of a better one) is taken prisoner and dragged in a basement, he is entirely stripped from his clothes and attached on a chair without a seat, letting 007's \"genitals\" dangling from underneath (Yes,you heard right). Le Chiffre proceeds to swing a large heavy rope and hits her majesty's favorite secret agent's nuts over and over. Bond screams in pain but does not reveal the bank account number. What a man. Does he escape? Does he fight back in the most ingenious manner and eliminates his torturer? No, he passes out and wakes up in a hospital.<br /><br />The torture may have stopped for Bond, but increases for me: Bond finds comfort in the arms of his girlfriend Vesper (yes, girlfriend) who tells him, to rebuild his pride, that even if the only thing left from him was his little finger, she would still love him. To which, the emasculated James Bond replies (watch out, humor coming your way): \"That's because you know what I can do with my little finger.\" Can we please stop talking about mister Bond smashed testicles and go on with this never-ending-going-nowhere-story?! And don't we know that if Bond was ever blown to smithereens, the only thing left from him should precisely be his genitals?<br /><br />There were other problems with the film of course,such as the boring story, and the fact that the casino (which seemed to be the perfect setting for a James Bond film) turned out to be so poorly exploited.<br /><br />Giving this film one star might not be fair (do you ever read a review unless it has a 1 or a 10 star rating?),but the main problem goes beyond the bad choices added by the filmmakers throughout the film. The problem is that the film was made with the wrong \"spirit\" and doesn't take in consideration that, unlike other movies, James Bond belongs more to the public than to its makers, and that this rare fact deserves to be honored.<br /><br />Don't mess with MY James Bond.\n",

            "This is one of the thoroughly enjoyable monster movies that appeared amid all the camp and trash the genre churned out in the 1950s. While it is no masterpiece, there is nothing worthy of serious criticism. The movie is well-paced with plenty of action--the viewer is not required to wait 45 minutes before anything at all happens. It is very well filmed, in a widescreen format (the only way it should be seen). And the acting by an exceptionally attractive cast is above average for this kind of film.<br /><br />As for the dinosaurs, they may not be up to the standards of \"Jurassic Park\" or \"Walking With Dinosaurs\", but, again, considering what the budget must have been, they are rather good (except for a slow-moving Tyrannosaurus).<br /><br />What really makes this movie worthwhile is its atmosphere. It draws the viewer into the reasonably convincing world of a tropical jungle in the middle of a polar icecap.<br /><br />A very likeable and exciting movie. See it in widescreen if you can.\n",

            "I just watched this movie on the Sci-fi network. Let's make one thing perfectly clear: there has never, ever been a quality film or television show that has used the phrase `It's on a need-to-know basis'. Once you hear that phrase, and its subsequent follow-up phrase `believe me, I need to know', you can rest assured you're watching something written by someone with absolutely no creativity.<br /><br />Sandra Bernhard is terribly miscast in this five hundredth derivation of `Alien'. Whining and sneering her way through this movie, she sounds ridiculously unconvincing spouting the technical mumbo-jumbo necessary for science fiction films. She aint no Sigourney Weaver, that's for sure. How someone so marvelous in something like `Roseanne' can be such a bad actor in films like this and `Hudson Hawk' is one of the mysteries of life.<br /><br />This film has the production values of a high-school play: cheap-looking sets, bad lighting, and clumsy-looking props. The spacesuits look like second-rate rejects from Joe's Army Surplus. When Sandra comes back into the ship after a spacewalk, she flips the visor lid up, and there's no seal around it! The flimsy visor looks like it was made from a clear plastic pie-cover from Safeway. There are no special effects, unless you call an exterior shot of the spaceship a special effect. They couldn't even spring for some fancy flashing lights or decent music; tapping military-style drumbeats punctuate some of the scenes, while someone practicing a bass fiddle provides the rest of the music.<br /><br />Typical of bad films, during the shootout scenes, many many shots are fired in all directions, but it is only coincidental that anyone gets hit, even at point-blank range. Is it wise to fire a gun onboard a spaceship while you're surrounded by all kinds of machinery that is keeping you alive?<br /><br />Most of the film consists of close-ups of people standing around talking or arguing while sepia-colored walls float in the background. I'm convinced that the dialogue was written by a thirteen-year-old boy after watching video games for eighteen hours straight: `she belongs to me', `it's stuck in a loop!', `you don't drink martinis!', and so forth. You get the idea.<br /><br />As if that isn't bad enough, a videotaped Laura San Giacomo rocks back and forth spouting Shakespeare. Good thing she had `Just Shoot Me' to fall back on.<br /><br />The only way to describe the quality of this film is that this is the kind of movie they show on Saturday afternoons when the football game is pre-empted. The television station figures `what the hell, there's no one watching anyway.' It's either that, or an infomercial.\n",

            "Tom Selleck and Jerry Reed are utterly engaging as rascally, penniless, down-on-their-luck cowboy drifters Will and J.D., who find themselves stuck in Nashville, Tennesse. A lovely young woman (the gorgeous Morgan Fairchild) mistakes the pair for private detectives and hires the affable duo to find her missing sister. Pretty soon both Will and J.D. are neck deep in all kinds of trouble. Briskly directed by Burt Kennedy, with a slight, inane cookie cutter script by Jimmy Sangster, crude cinematography by Victor Salzis and Alan Stensvold, a jaunty hillbilly bluegrass country score by Reed (who also sings the rousing theme song \"Breakin' Loose\") and the expected copious slapstick fist fights and wacky car chases, this totally inconsequential piece of made-for-TV piffle makes for a perfectly enjoyable diversion. The loose'n'wiggy chemistry between Selleck and Reed is a treat to watch. Solid supporting turns by Claude Akins as a famous country singer/songwriter, Gene Evans as a gruff police lieutenant, Lucille Benson as a stern, but friendly whorehouse madam, and Grace Zabriskie as a wax museum worker are likewise delightful. Special guest appearances by country stars Roy Acuff, Ray Stevens and Barbara Mandrell as themselves further add to the goofy fun. A likably silly timewaster.\n",

            "Gloria (Erika Eleniak) is a rich man's daughter and, therefore, requires a bodyguard. Since she is just a tad ornery, the security men come and go. Aaron (Dylan Walsh), who used to guard an aging Hollywood leading lady (Barbara Eden), has just been hired by Gloria's father to watch over his gorgeous, young offspring. Things do not get off to a good start when Gloria takes Aaron on a private plane ride and they narrowly miss crashing the aircraft. But, more excitement is around the corner. Gloria insists on taking a cruise on a refurbished old ship, The Queen Mary, where all of the beautiful people will be. Aaron, who \"hates to travel\", is unhappy about the trip yet, he must go along. On the vessel, also, is the wealthy businessman who provided the funds to spruce up the ship, as well as a hotshot football player and a lovely television journalist, who has a past with Aaron. But, wait, that's not the whole guest list! A terrorist thug named Josef (Ice T), his tough-as-nails girlfriend, Max (Claudia Christian) and his gang are on board, too, to steal the jewels and artwork that some of the passengers put in the ship's safe, since they couldn't sail off without their Van Goghs! Josef has a plan and a large arsenal of weapons. Will he succeed in carrying out his pilfering, without damaging the ship, of course? This is just a terrible film that sinks and stinks, from the first moment to the last. That is not to say the nice cast, including the good-looking Walsh, the lovely Eleniak, and the sullen Ice-T don't try to breathe life into the thing....they do try. But, not enough. The script is one abysmal cliché after another and the direction and editing are horrible, too. All right, the costumes are fine, are you happy? Especially so is the hot little blue number Eleniak wears through most of the second half. Therefore, if you are a fan of any of the cast members, you are certainly within your rights to rent this film. Why not show the movie at a gathering of couples, where everyone can laugh, jeer, and throw things at the screen? It would certainly make for an \"alternative\" party experience.\n",

            "The Omega man may now receive renewed attention as a result of the current and third re-make of the original story from which it derives, \"I Am Legend\".<br /><br />Whilst \"I Am Legend\" may well be more faithful to the original book, that text, however, is an unremarkable piece of escapist sci-fi. Whereas The Omega Man, using the story as a vehicle, developed it into what may now be read as an uncannily insightful analysis of latent undercurrents of late twentieth century culture.<br /><br />The Omega Man replaces the rather puerile vampire theme with that of a reactionary cult of anti-science. The epidemic that supposedly turns people into blood-sucking Buffy-beasts in the original story is replaced by a rather more believable illness of which symptoms are aversion to light and insanity. A TV news anchorman, using the technology of mass communications that science has put at his disposal, is shown as opportunistically exploiting the biological disaster to create a religious cult that entirely renounces science, with himself as its head.<br /><br />Aspects of this scenario reflected elements within the \"hippy\" movement that was nearly contemporaneous with the movie's making. The nascent \"Luddite\" reactionary element that was in hippiedom has swelled in prominence in the years since the movie was made, as the less harsh themes of Sixties \"counter-culture\", libertarianism and the renunciation of top-down political dogma, have evaporated. Today, in the mature, even decadent technological societies, the principal themes of culture and politics are a renunciation of science and the reassertion of mediaeval religious dogmas. These two elements frequently intertwine. Whilst the \"environmentalist\" political dogma seeks to dictate from above every aspect of everyday life for every citizen, the state has launched into a millennial conflict with renascent mediaevalist religion as it is expressed overseas in \"terrorist\" movements.<br /><br />Seen from today's perspective, Charlton Heston's depiction of the isolated, besieged man of science, Dr Neville, seems eerily evocative for the embattled minority of us who cling to the ideal of scientific truth that is now under attack. As in The Omega Man, we now see the mass media that is a product of science used by that media's own opportunistic elements to generate a hostility to science that they can then play to their own advantage. We have reached the point at which to dare raise the pseudo-scientific nature of the dominant political ideology that is environmentalism is to risk being rendered an outcast, like Neville.<br /><br />A far-fetched fantasy adventure at the time of it's making, The Omega Man now seems to have uncannily anticipated the major political themes of life in the early Twenty-First Century. A truly prophetic parable of our times.\n",

            "There have been several screen adaptations of the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story, some based closely on the Robert Louis Stevenson story, of which probably the best known are Robert Mamoulian's 1931 and Victor Fleming's 1941 versions. Others have been looser with the story. Mary Reilly is based on a novel by Valerie Martin and tells the story from the perspective of a housemaid in Dr. Jekyll's household. It also tells the story as more of a dark romance than a horror movie, as Mary Reilly, the title character develops a strange romantic triangle with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and has simultaneous feelings of attraction and revulsion.<br /><br />It is an interesting concept and it makes a good story. But in my opinion, it wasn't executed well on screen. I have liked Julia Roberts in some of her performances, but she just wasn't convincing in this one at all. And John Malkovich wasn't menacing or evil enough as Mr. Hyde. Perhaps I shouldn't have expected the same physical unattractiveness for Mr. Hyde as in other versions of the story, since Mary Reilly clearly found something to attract her, but I didn't see much difference between the good doctor and the evil beast. I also didn't find the dialog in the film to be very inspiring. The settings were okay, but nothing terribly special.<br /><br />I think it is fair to say that I was disappointed with this film and that I didn't think it was very good, though it was far from the worst film I've ever seen.\n",

            "\"Carandiru\" is Hector (\"Kiss of the Spider Woman\") Babenco's sweeping epic about life inside the notorious Brazilian prison of the same name, which was demolished in 2002 following a brutal riot during which 111 prisoners were killed (execution style, supposedly) and not one cop or guard was killed.<br /><br />The film is based on a book called \"Carandiru Station\", written by Babenco's former doctor, who was the official prison doctor for several years. Babenco, who has made other films about Latin American prison life (\"Pixote\", \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\") was intrigued and decided to film it.<br /><br />The whole thing is told from the point of view of the doctor, who spends a great deal of his time trying to educate the prison population about the spread of AIDS which many catch through homosexual sex and dope needles. The bulk of the film involves prisoners coming to see him and telling him (us) the story of how they wound up behind bars. Most of the stories are sad and tragic but not without humor and compassion.<br /><br />The prison itself is not at all like what we in America associate with a prison. Carandiru is more like a super scummy apartment complex. The prisoners come and go with a shocking amount of freedom. The whole thing is basically run by the prisoners. The cells look almost like apartments. On visiting day women and kids wander freely in and around the cells and halls. Very strange.<br /><br />The last third of the film is a re-creation of the horrific riot which claimed the lives of so many prisoners.<br /><br />The film is similar in many ways to \"City of God\" in that its basically an extended Brazilian crime saga. But where \"City of God\" is nihilistic and adrenaline-pumped, \"Carandiru\" is compassionate and humanistic. Make no mistake, this is a brutal, brutal film. But Babenco really strives to turn the prisoners into characters the audience can understand and even empathize with. None of them are scary, blank-faced killers like Lil Ze in \"City of God\". The violence that happens happens for a very tangible reason, often leaving a tragic feel. The prisoners seem very trapped in lives filled with disease and drugs and vendettas.<br /><br />A sad film, but also one with a great deal of humor. Prisoners like Highness, who is eternally juggling two women at the same time (even while in prison!). And Dagger, a brutal killer who is suddenly paralyzed by guilt over his actions. The images of him wandering, wraith-like, through the yard are haunting.<br /><br />A superb film. Highly recommended\n",

I never heard of him but Frank Zappa produced one of his albums and he was the initial pitchman for Rhino records and recorded the Rhino radio jingle. Wild Man Fischer suffers from paranoid schizophrenia which has profoundly impacted his life and career. In some of the concern footage from the early 60's you see him jamming with Frank Zappa (very nice to see him again) and see glimpses of what might have been. For years Dr. Demento was a big fan. In fact he played once at Giants stadium with Zappa, Janice Joplin, The Byrds and Hendrix so he wasn't a hack. If you have never been around true mental illness this film is an eye-opener. Mental illness isn't funny; in fact it is extremely scary. Fascinating movie. Two things stand out for me. The first is Billy Mummy (the kid from \"Lost in Space\") turned out pretty well. In fact he seemed to have his stuff together. He might be Wild Man's only friend. The second was the Dr. Demento puppet show where Frank Zappa finds out how crazy Wild Man really is and breaks it off. The family interviews are touching and tragic. His family has pretty much stuck by Wild Man all these years and seem to truly care about his welfare. From the Aunt dying of cancer who gives him a place to live to his brother dropping off groceries. A wonderful glimpse into the birth of Rock and Roll and a life completely out of control.

And that's about it for the good parts.<br /><br />Even the cast can't lift this wartime espionage thriller above the routine. James Mason is a splendid actor but should have stayed away from any role calling for a foreign accent. In \"The Desert Rats\" he mangled German. Here he does to a French accent what the Luftwaffe did to Stalingrad.<br /><br />Michael Wilding sounds positively uncomfortable with his working-class London locutions. Karel Stepanek, who made virtually a career out of playing Nazis, at least SOUNDS right but the role seems to have come by way of a cookie cutter. What a stereotype. I can't blame the writers too much, though -- this being written in 1942, a bad year for the Allies.<br /><br />Let's say this is an historical curiosity. The future held better things for most of the people involved in this low-budget thriller.\n",

Frank and company should have taken a cue from the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour and realized that you just can't shoot random weirdness and expect to have a watchable movie.<br /><br />The music's just ok, too. This version of the Mothers with Flo and Eddie was never one of my favorites. Still, the film does kind of suck you in and dares you to watch it. Some of the really old and cheeseball special effects, reverse film tricks, etc. come off as disturbing, but all in all, this is quite a snooze.\n",

            "<br /><br />After Seeing the other works of the directors (Coneheads & The Last Unicorn) I didn't really expect much in this movie, since its older and the directors might not have done better earlier in their career. I also didn't think it could get any worse, but it did. You start off with the dwarves meeting Bilbo a little too fast, and the music starts. The horrible music was so annoying I could hardly concentrate on the plot of the movie. When they get to after they meet the eagles I though they had skipped a part of the movie. I thought they really screwed up, but no they left out an important character (Beorn). I believe he was too important to just skip him. He was a big part in helping them on their journey. I don't think the goblins really looked good. They don't look like goblins to me they look more like an orc would. I think Don Messick should have stuck to doing the voice of Scooby Doo. To me he wasn't a good Bilbo. If they rated the movie today they would probably give it a G rating (in less the deaths of some of the creatures was too violent). Most of the voices were good but they were just stuck with a bad project and bad directors who seem to get stuck with bad movies a lot more.\n",

In my opinion, the only reason to watch the show is to listen to Robert Stack as he does a take off of his old TV \"Untouchables\"character. In most of the episodes the over-the-top Stoat has his mind blanked after discovering the Martians. The mind wipe ends with Stoat folding onto the ground and saying something along the lines of, \"I don't like the darkness, Mommie.\" I only tuned into the show because I learned Stack was to be on the show and continued to watch because of him, but I was not supervised to see it canceled.\n",

            "I made the mistake of buying the film off Amazon.com. Please do NOT do so. The film is not gated correctly and 1/3rd of the image is cut off, plus there is no soundtrack. This is probably the reason this film is rated so poorly by IMDb reviewers here. I rate it 10 because it deserves a 10 artistically and creatively as a film. <br /><br />The version to get of The Peach Girl is sold off the San Francisco Silent Film Festival website with the Donald Sosin soundtrack, a lovely one, though for some reason toward the end it sounds a bit warped in spots; I don't know why. This print is gated correctly, though still a bit rough going in terms of visuals; the print has a lot of wear. However if you are the kind of person who can see the diamond here hiding underneath the rough, and wish to see one of the most beautiful Chinese silent films ever made, then don't miss The Peach Girl.<br /><br />Lingyu Ruan was so beautiful and evocative as the peasant girl whose life is symbolic of the peach trees in the countryside where she lives. She falls in love with the son of the rich woman who owns the property she and her father and mother toil on, but is betrayed by him when she gets pregnant out of wedlock. Yan Jin gives an incredible performance as the son; his face was expressive and emotional and brings depth to his role. You feel his agony as his mother locks him in his room for months so that he cannot go find his lost love and make it right by her.<br /><br />The title cards are in Chinese and English, and many have decorative backgrounds, always a plus for me when I watch silent films. It adds visual interest to the story.<br /><br />The Peach Girl (1931) and The Goddess (1934) are the easiest available silent films showcasing the loveliness of \"the Chinese Garbo\", Lingyu Ruan, and both are worthy of your time and interest. It is so tragic that she committed suicide so young. What wonderful performances we were deprived of!\n",

            "On a dark and stormy night in Yeehaw Georgia, a powerful electrical storm downs the power lines, and the electricity floods the muddy ground, awakening the vast population of worms! Unfortunately, the electricity doesn't turn the worms into Giant Worms, or mutant worms, it just makes them kind of cranky. <br /><br />Enter Mick, a wimpy antique enthusiast who has come to Georgia on vacation to visit his Southern Belle girlfriend Jerri, a scrawny redhead with an outrageous Scarlet O'Hara accent. Jerri lives with her whacked out mother and her odd looking sister, and is stalked by the local worm salesman's son Roger, a big dumb guy with an IQ of a cucumber. Mick's vacation turns out to be anything but restful, as he encounters a worm in a chocolate soda, a skeleton on the ground and a creepy sheriff with frightening teeth and gravity defying hair. By the time he and Jerri realize what is happening in the small town of Fly Creek, it is too late. The worms flood the streets and houses like an angry swarm of spaghetti, consuming any and all who stand in their way. Will anyone survive the night?<br /><br />I've never been able to figure out if this was supposed to be a black comedy or if we're supposed to take the worm threat seriously. Either way, the only thing this film did for me was to make me feel incredibly filthy. Filmed on location in Georgia, this film was also too convincing in it's portrayal of the rural south: I kept waiting for the banjo music to start up, kept waiting for Roger or the sheriff to ask Mick to \"squeal like a pig.\" I couldn't feel sorry for the people who ended up as worm food because they were all so icky. I didn't care if young lovers Mick and Jerri lived to see another day - they're both so wimpy and whiny you won't care much either. The only character I actually enjoyed was Alma, Jerri's kid Amazon sister with her smart ass attitude and weird clothes. Other than that, I spent the majority of the film cheering on the worms.\n",

Just like the efficient worker bees in Bee Movie, this is what happens when everyone does their role right: the cast, the director, the writers, editors, the animators, etc. Everything just hums along smoothly with nary a glitch.<br /><br />Bee Movie works even if it is heavily reliant on the incredible comic timing of lead bee voice-over Jerry Seinfeld, who delivers the laughs as his whiny but likable stand-up comic personality is retained even in cartoon bee form. He plays Barry Benson, a fresh grad who goes against the drones of bees who are satisfied working one job for the rest of their lives in the comfort of their hive. He ventures out into the dangerous world and meets florist Vanessa Bloome (Renee Zellweger), who saves his life and helps him sue the human race for illegally taking bee honey for their own profit. Matthew Broderick plays his best friend and sympathetic foil Adam.<br /><br />The impressive graphics of Bee Movie draw you in, making you feel like you're part of it. The visuals are so vivid it's almost extra-sensory; it would be great to see this in 4D where you can even smell the flowers, feel the rain, wind and sunshine, and taste the honey! It's hard not to tear up and feel emotional in several parts of the movie, no matter how incredulous the plot is, unlike in other recent animated disappointments such as Enchanted and Shrek the Third. The dialogue, animation and story all appeal to adults and children alike; all that help make Bee Movie immensely enjoyable!\n",

Gene Nelson gives a good performance as a man haunted by his past. Steve Lacey is so scarred by his past that it runs his current life, this eventually leads him into trouble. Andre De Toth keeps most of the film in the shadows and only a few scenes take place during the day. Even the climatic robbery is shot in the dark. The only false note is that Hayden's character doesn't act the same throughout the movie. I found the movie to be pretty brutal for the time and Charles Bronson did a good job portraying most of the brutality. All in all, a worthy entry in the film noir genre.\n",

            "While not quite a masterpiece, the movie is really funny in places and has some inspired moments. But the best thing about it is the huge cast of comedy allstars (some of whom were still relatively unknown at the time) that make appearances. It would almost be easier to list the comedy stars who aren't in the movie. Not only is there a huge contingent of SNL stars from the 70s up to the 90s (Aykroyd, Curtin, Garret Morris, Laraine Newman, Jan Hooks, Michael McKean, Julia Sweeney, Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, Jon Lovitz, Phil Hartman, Kevin Nealon, Tim Meadows, David Spade, etc.) but others like Jason Alexander, Drew Carey, Michael Richards, Dave Thomas, Joey Lauren Adams, Parker Posey and Tom Arnold. Seems like almost every scene has a cameo from somebody. My vote for funniest goes to Jan Hooks as the driving student who tries to seduce Aykroyd. The dentists office scene with Lovitz is also unbeatable. The movie's premise is so bizarre that along with all the cameos, watching it is pretty surreal. Most characters in the movie barely notice or mention the cones; most of the time the coneheads make little effort to fit in, and only a few people seem to notice the difference. I guess New Jersey is even stranger than I had imagined. The movie is just interestingly weird. It must be one of the best movies of all time for intoxication.\n",

The use of music is also powerful and moving. Reygadas has really proved himself a force in cinema with this film. <br /><br />Thematically, the film touches on many views -- one example if the fact that almost everyone looks ugly in this film, yet not repulsive. There is also a sense of raw sexual abandonment despite the lack of eroticism. <br /><br />As well, the film deals with Mexican nationalism, and its Catholicism, and the army, in ways that will have relevance for Mexicans. There is beauty in this movie and the feeling of life's inherent tragedy. Decadence is present and evil casually introduced as an aside. You will also be awed by the bravery of the actors and moved by the raw and close-to-real sex acts.\n",

You feel like you're watching a retro fashion show, as Cate models a wool skirt, and then a tight-fitting green sweater, and there she is in a crimson outfit topped with a beret. The wardrobe is fantastic, but one can't be blamed for wondering how a Scottish agent dropped into Vichy France with nothing but a parachute and a pocketful of cyanide managed to assemble such a dashing wardrobe in a farming village.<br /><br />The script essentially relies on sexual tension to function properly, and it doesn't, because the gentlemen cast opposite Kate are such bland pretty boys -- soap opera sidemen -- that you only feel uncomfortable for them when things start heating up in the bedroom. It may be that there actually aren't any leading men fit to play opposite Ms. Blanchett in this year 2002 as a consequence of 10 years of increasingly vapid and effeminite chiseled-jaw frat boys taking over the screen, but regardless of the systemic explanations, there's not much to do but blush or laugh when you note that Billy Crudup's voice is registering about an octave higher than Ms. Blanchett's. Tilt.<br /><br />The direction is lamentable. The movie plays like a shoddily-constructed Merchant-Ivory film; you're left with the bad parts of the genre (artificiality, preciousness), without any of the good (smart, adult, sexy). While the movie isn't wretched in the fashion of pap like \"The Majestic\", it is indeed painful to sit through as one scene after another drags the stale plot through the French countryside. It's like the director, Gillian Armstrong, is trying to flog sentiment out of the audience in a battle of endurance. By the time the 3rd act rolls around and Armstrong starts throwing in title cards like \"6 months later\" and \"1945: Peace\" you've long since had enough and are only wanting to see one title card: The End.\n",

While watching some in house entertainment at a casino Claire is hypnotised by an English clairvoyant named Cecil Howard. Claire suffers a vivid hallucination about a sadistic SS officer named Olivier (Robert Bristol) in a Nazi concentration camp. After the show Claire talks with Howard and invites him to supper. Soon after she leaves Howard is killed by what appears to be a red light (don't ask). Meanwhile a old Jewish man named Abraham Weiss (Marc Lawrence) who is a Nazi hunter spots Olivier on a T.V. programme and recognises him as the man he has been after for years. Weiss immediately tells his story to bitter, overworked police officer Lieutenant Sterne (Cameron Mitchell) who lives just across the hall from him. Sterne agrees to look into Weiss's claims but eventually admits there is nothing he can do, especially after Weiss gives him some newspaper cuttings from 1944 which appear to show Olivier but since the paper is over 30 years old and Olivier would now be in his 60' or 70's and the guy on T.V. is still in his 20's & therefore Weiss's story is psychically impossible. That night Weiss is found dead in a parking lot. Lt. Sterne decides to take a personal interest and investigate even further. Claire is starting to lose her mind. Her husband James is about to publish a book called 'God is dead' in which James claims God does not and never has existed. Claire as a stout Catholic is deeply against the book and tries to convince James not to publish it. Olivier, who runs a cult of Satan worshippers, feels James would be a good person to have on board and attempts to convince James to join him and his organisation. A guy with a beard named Papini (Maurice Grandmaison) tries to warn James about Olivier, Satan and his book denouncing God. Various people die including Claire's nephew Jim (Klint Stevenson), Claire decides that she alone must put an end to Olivier and Satan himself. Claire and Jim's girlfriend Ann (Christie Wagner) conduct a bizarre plan that Claire believes will destroy Olivier for good, but will it succeed?<br /><br />According to the IMDb's credit list Cataclysm was directed by three separate people, Phillip Marshak, Tom McGowan & Gregg C. Tallas as Greg Tallas. I am not sure if this information is correct but I don't think I've ever heard of a film directed by three different people and maybe that's why it turned out to be a bit of a jumbled up mess. The script by Philip Yordan tries something different and for that it should get at least an extra point. Even though at the end of the day it's still a mess with the story all over the place. Things just happen for little reason, characters aren't that likable and the dialogue in certain scenes isn't up to much. The story becomes occasionally confusing and unfocused. The script comes across as heavy handed at times with it's religious overtones and story arc. Almost as if Yordan wanted to make a thought provoking horror film with a message, obviously it fails, badly. Cataclysm starts out very interesting and draws the viewer in by not revealing too much, too soon. Unfortunately this decision to try and make the plot more mysterious back fires during the middle third as it gets somewhat boring waiting for something to happen but then things explode into a gore drenched finale. The acting is OK for this type of low budget nonsense, except Cift who seems to speak her lines really slowly compared to everyone else. And it's always nice to see genre veteran Cameron Mitchell. Some characters appear dubbed throughout. There is very little, in fact none, blood or gore in the film until the last 10 minutes or so when the red stuff is splashed everywhere. In this sequence there is some real surgery footage in a blood soaked over the top climax to round the film off. I think the film itself was shot on location rather than studio's and has a generally good feel throughout, the production values were much better than I expected. While not brilliant by any stretch of the imagination the photography, editing, special effects, continuity and music are all reasonable enough and I've sat through a lot worse. I'm sure a lot of people will automatically call this film crap as it's an easy target but for those of us who like this sort of off-beat grade-z low budget horror film from days gone by than this one may interest you and is probably worth tracking down. Just because it dares to try something a little different if for no other reason, it doesn't always succeed but at least those involved tried. Overall I'm glad I watched it, certainly not the best film in the world but then did anyone really expect it to be?\n",

            "Coming from 1956 is another of Universal-International's science-fiction pleasures. They made about twenty of them in the 1950s, brought on by the enormous successes of \"It Came From Outer Space\" (1953) and \"Creature From the Black Lagoon\" (1954). An interesting prologue with a real professor on the Earth's interior cores is followed by a great title sequence accompanied by a superb score. John Agar leads an archaeological expedition in Himalayan mountains to search for an underground lost civilization. Eventually they find them, an albino tribe, who have trained the half-human \"Mole People\" to be their slaves. Agar falls in love with the lone pigmented character, lovely blonde Cynthia Patrick, who invokes a bit of Kim Novak. Sacrifices, revolt and chaos ensue, with the Mole People actually the sympathetic characters, an unexpected ending, shadowy photography, and solid direction by Virgil Vogel, make this enjoyable.\n",

            "\"Demonoid:The Messenger of Death\" is an entertaining and bizarre Mexican horror flick about a mine proprietor(Roy C. Jensen),his gorgeous wife (Samantha Eggar) and the hand case found by them in an underground mine chamber.During the night the dust turns back into a flying hand,which promptly starts possessing people.Admittedly this crazy horror flick is really bad,but I had lots of fun watching it.Its premise is similar to Oliver Stone's \"The Hand\":a possessed severed hand is stalking people.The possession of the left hand creates the opportunities for many bizarre scenes:a hand literally catching the train,fortune hunter dynamites his own mine- with his entire crew still inside it and a policeman pulls his pistol on a surgeon and insists the MD amputate the cop's arm sans anesthesia to name only a few.Watch \"Demonoid\" as soon as possible.7 out of 10.\n",

            "This was a great 1933 Classic film to enjoy the great acting of Ann Harding, (Joan Colby) and William Powell, (John Fletcher). This film takes place during the great depression and Joan Colby is an older woman who has not married and her sister, Valerie Colby, (Lucile Brown) is planning to get married which sort of puts the pressure on Joan to do the same thing and not become an old maid. Joan takes an interest in John Fletcher, (William Powell) who is the owner of a Steamship business and at the same time a playboy with lots of women and his business is not doing very well. However, Joan is aware of John's way of living and she manages to trick him into marrying her, even though she does not love him and he has the exact same feelings towards her. After several months of marriage, this couple decide to get a divorce and end their so called marriage relationship. During these months of marriage, Joan is able to conduct business meetings with government people and is able to secure contracts for the Steamship business. John continues to play around, but Joan never gives up on John and the plot gets a bit complicated. From some of the background photography this film wants you to believe this story takes place in San Francisco, California. Enjoy a great old time Classic film.\n",

            "Films, no matter low-budget, high-budget, no-budget need to have one essential element to ensure that the time dedicated to the characters, emotions, and themes is not futile. That, singular strong moment, has to be story. Whether it is a horror film, a sci-fi film, or even a Bergman avant-garde film, there needs to be at least a small strain of story carrying the viewer from point A to point B, if that is missing  the entire structure of the film will collapse. Characters you can ignore, emotion can be faked, and the themes can be murky, but without that central story  your film will ultimately be found in the dollar bin at the nearest retail chop shop. Despite Harvey Keitel, Viggo Mortensen, Thandie Newton, and a slew of British accents  that is why \"The Young Americans\" failed. Absolutely it was a dark crime noir, a family retribution, and a love story, but the story in \"The Young Americans\" was so weak, that getting to the different point, the different scenes, felt rushed, unfamiliar, and murky. This jumbled, muddled mess of a film boasts cheapness from every angle, but due to the missing story  \"The Young Americans\" fails to be anything more than a random Harvey Keitel stumble at the store, or a cheap recommendation because you rented \"Reservoir Dogs\".<br /><br />With the sound of raves in the background, the viewer is pulled right into the youth of Britain circa mid-90s. Dance parties, gangs, and late nights plague the screen as groups of genuine unknowns get killed in the night. This should have been an indication of what the remainder of the film would be like, but I trudged onward  and definitely not upward. After the brutal killings, we are swooped into the world of Harvey Keitel, or anti-antagonist (seemingly blending together every cop cliché/genre) John Harris. Brought in to help with a murder, we soon learn that there is a secondary motive in play  something that has to do with a very young, an extremely overacted, Viggo Mortensen. As we jump from one frame to another, one initial drawback are the dark, character building scenes  literally, there is the concept of symbolic lighting to set the tone  but director Danny Cannon used so much darkness some scenes are blank on the screen. Missing more than a fourth of the film, we are forced to follow an unknown path between Keitel, Mortensen, love-interest Thandie Newton, and relative newbie Craig Kelly. It is his story that transfers the power from Keitel, but is equally as unappetizing. After the death of a family member, Kelly's Christian decides to turn against the crew that did it, becoming a powerful tool for Keitel, but the whos, whats, wheres, whens, and whys are never answered  still giving us nothing but quick scenes, literally teleporting us from point A to point B, without reason or consequence.<br /><br />As mentioned, the story is the ultimate failure of the film. There were actions made by our characters that did not seem to fit within the realm that Danny Cannon had created, but he continued to push through. Nothing was answered, situations were randomly created, and why was Viggo Mortensen's character so underdeveloped, yet so vital to the story? Who knows. That question became the downtrodden central theme to this film, and a reason why \"The Young Americans\" will never see success. With our story a clustered mess, how did the rest fair beneath the control of Cannon? Not surprisingly, the British were believable and grounded. The minor characters, perhaps outside of Craig Kelly, felt like real police and the setting (due to extensive British TV watching) felt like Britain 1993, but the influx of the American presence just ruined the rest. Keitel could have been Steven Seagul or JCVD, he was not cunning, nothing brilliant, just an American cop-dislocated and fighting against the shadow of a drug dealer. The entire subplot with his ex-wife was nothing short of embarrassing. Used to build his character, it just felt more like a cheap trick instead of honest emotion. The same can be said with Viggo Mortensen, who with choppy editing by Danny Cannon, never quite developed past the notion of \"creepy guy\". With a voice that sounded like a Lynch character, an unknown occupation, and a purpose to be in Britain (let's not forget his peculiarity towards young men), Mortensen felt more like a placemat than a villain. On the other side of this film, Newton read her lines well, and Craig Kelly attempted to work around Cannon and David Hilton's catastrophe of a script. It was obvious the actors were found, the script was heavily edited, and the final product was a rushed pile of poorly constructed LEGOs. One flick of your finger, it will all go crumbling down.<br /><br />Overall, in case it hasn't been noticed, this was an abomination of a film. From the darkly lit scenes (you have to watch to believe how dark this film was), to the atrocious acting, to the story that went nowhere but somehow ended up at the final credits, \"The Young Americans\" was a direct to video release for a reason. Shot in 38 days, this film felt rushed and incomplete. Mortensen's character is the one I struggle with the most, as the ending leads us to believe that this was supposed to be a different film than the one we began or watched. There were too many wild-cards (see Jack Doyle) that muddled the main story. It is a murky mess that is easily forgotten and should be avoided. Danny Cannon may have given us \"CSI\" and \"Judge Dredd\", but this is an incompetent film that will appeal to nobody and fails miserably.<br /><br />Grade: * out of *****\n",

            "There is a scene early on in \"Jury Duty\" when Pauly Shore stands on a bus and imitates a town tour guide. It is obvious that this scene was written to showcase Pauly Shore's comedic talents, however, he makes noises and is loud and generally obnoxious and unfunny. <br /><br />\"Jury Duty\" is the point where Pauly Shore officially abused his stay in movies. After this movie, he would forever be sanctioned to the lunch table in the corner with the smelly kid, Carrot Top and the Noid from the Dominoes commercials. But not until he showed the world his versatility in Bio-Dome.<br /><br />Jury Duty is bad. Not bad like \"In the Army Now,\" but close. There is little originality to the script, no amusing characters and about four funny lines. I did enjoy the scene where the witnesses from restaurants give testimonies in their respective fast food uniforms. There isn't much else here. It just isn't funny.<br /><br />Shore also lacks the wit his idiotic leading men contemporaries like Adam Sandler and Chris Farley showed in the 90s. These were all, more or less, bad versions of Steve Martin's wonderful \"Jerk\" character. All Shore shows in this movie is that he has the talent to bug you. <br /><br />Of course, not all the blame can be put on his shoulders. He has no script to work with. Nothing. I don't know why Stanley Tucci thought this movie would be good for him and or how the studio blackmailed him into being in it.<br /><br />I remembered both \"Encino Man\" and \"Son in Law\" were kind of funny in a stupid way. \"Jury Duty \" on the other hand is stupid in a very unfunny way.\n",

            "Scorpio was a film Burt Lancaster didn't think too much of according to a recent biography and after viewing it I can certainly see why.<br /><br />On the plus side Lancaster got to work with former co-stars Alain Delon from The Leopard and with Paul Scofield from The Train, both films considerably better than Scorpio. Too bad he wasn't given something better than a warmed over espionage story.<br /><br />Lancaster is a CIA agent suspected of being a double agent. Word has come from on high to terminate his existence. Not an easy task by any means. Lancaster hasn't survived in the spy business by being a dummy for thirty years.<br /><br />From French intelligence the CIA borrows hit-man Alain Delon who has worked and trained with Lancaster. He's got the title role as one nicknamed Scorpio because of the way he strikes. <br /><br />Lancaster has an ace or two up his sleeve also. An old friend with the KGB, Paul Scofield, is willing to help up to a point.<br /><br />Here's where there is a real problem. Both Lancaster and Scofield are identified by the script as having served in Loyalist Spain with 'volunteer' groups. Of course in the Soviet case I'm sure volunteering was strongly urged.<br /><br />In America however that would have been the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. And during the post World War II McCarthy era that was one of a group of organizations past and present that was considered a Communist front. <br /><br />I'm sorry, but there ain't NO WAY that Lancaster with that in his background would have ever gotten a job with the Central Intelligence Agency. And if he did, he would have been found out and dismissed back then and there. The whole story falls apart knowing this.<br /><br />There are some nice location shots of Vienna and of Washington, DC in Scorpio and acting honors if any go to Paul Scofield. But the film is one colossal waste of time.\n",

            "I'm also surprised by some of the negative commentary around 'For your Consideration'. The satire seemed to me to be to be quite precise - particularly in its analysis of the average actor's life - which is a lot more like \"For Your Consideration\" or Ricky Gervais's brilliant \"The Extras\" than anything you're likely to see on Entertainment Tonight that is for sure.<br /><br />Having studied method acting over several years (a long time ago), and having worked as an extra at different low points in my life (never ever again), I have to say that I laughed till I cried. Without giving the ending away,Marilyn Hacke's closing scene is so on the money - what a cracker!<br /><br />Acting, actor training and film are all open to exploitation of the gullible because so many people are desperate to be part of it; consequently it's an area ripe for satire. For me, this was more on the money than \"Waiting for Guffman\" although I enjoyed that too. For your consideration has sharper edges. I think it's great that Ricky Gervais performs in this film. Gervaise is such an 'English' comic whilst Guest's sensibilities are very American - but in the shared fascination with human idiosyncracies, banalities and foibles, they both create a very contemporary form of the comedy of manners.\n",

            "(Minor Spoilers)<br /><br />Let's be honest and a tad realistic about this film, shall we?<br /><br />By TODAY'S standards, this is a \"cheesy\" kinda film compared to what technology we've got. And I think at the time of this release we had gotten \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and \"Star Wars\" so our expectation levels were running higher for \"special effects\" and \"whimsy\" than this.<br /><br />But I still can get entertainment out of this film.<br /><br />How?<br /><br />By remembering how old I was when I saw it and WHOM I was with when I saw it. My family.<br /><br />I was a child. This film wasn't in my all time top ten, but it was...fun. It was one of those movies local channels threw on Sunday afternoon before or after a televised ball game..or when a ball game was rained out. Come on, admit it..you remember!<br /><br />And that's the point. This film's special effects were nice..not spectacular..not even up to Ray Harryhausen's standards, but the Harryhausen mark was there which made it entertaining (Admit it, you LOVED the walrus scene!! How 'bout that Cyclops?!?! As a child this was all good! You remember!!).<br /><br />For very young girls, this Sinbad was REALLY nice to look at back then. For the very young guys, so was Miss Jane Seymour and Miss Taryn Power. Then there was the story which was kinda fun, the adventure which was kinda whimsical and the happy ending where the bad guys got theirs'.<br /><br />This was done at a time of assuming children would love this kinda stuff. Back then, more would have. Now, most children don't even think \"Spy Kids\" can give them a buzz.<br /><br />This movie is about childhood and remembering what it was like to have an imagination and watch a story unfold for nothing but the sheer enjoyment of it...the fun of eating \"Good 'n' Plenty\", \"Snowcaps\", \"Malted Milk Balls\" and Popcorn without thinking about calorie content to make this even more fun to watch...and the \"eye candy\" of Wayne, Seymour and Power help a so-so story that's really better than a lot of stuff I've seen today that they charge ya $10 a ticket for! Parents may not have liked it as much as the children but that too is part of the fun!<br /><br />Have a heart when watching this. Watch this as a \"fun\" romp....as remembering when families watched shows together (..or in my case my dad mumbling under his breath about how the game was due on and he had to sit through this 'crap' first!), the pre-teen tingles of watching a handsome Wayne, young Seymour and/or Power (...ya know...before having breast implants and weighing 95 pounds was mandatory in Hollywood for women to do this kind of film work?!?) and telling your parents you were REALLY interested in the story...really.<br /><br />Maybe I've got a more \"nostalgic\" view about this film..its because I'm not looking for academy award winning material with this kind of film, but it does its job of...entertaining...and if you have children and want them to be children for a tad longer, this may be the film fare for them. Or just for you, if you want to curl up with some popcorn and remember \"the good old movie fluff days\" where special effects were done by hand and stop motion photography by the \"grand-daddy\" of the genre and a Sinbad movie where Sinbad actually looked like you might imagined him to look like back then and evil characters who were evil and got theirs....pretty much simplified.<br /><br />Open your mind and when you have a moment...enjoy. Don't take it seriously just sit back... watch...and HAVE FUN..with your children, as a family.\n",

It seems It could have been in black and white to give more power to the images with the type of music Fito Paez selected to make. It was like try too hard and too much of it. That piano Psycho style. I don't know. Too strange. Unless you want to go on that direction. Then go on that direction with the movie too. May be it would have been a darker picture (with high contrast too) for a darker subject matter.<br /><br />I like Cecilia and Gael. These characters are difficult to identify with unless you are going thru the same thing. I spoke with an friend from Argentina and said that Gael accent was petty good. Remember, Argentinians are picky, so I believed him.<br /><br />The camera could have moved more and Fito could have play more with the close ups much better (Philadelhia movie style).You know, Jonathan Demme.<br /><br />It's no doubt that music could have better to get you in tone with the movie.<br /><br />This story is a little hard to believe. If this has happen before to someone, that person should tell this story.<br /><br />Fito, it seems you have money. Please use it wisely in movies. There are more fascinating stories where I am sure you can make more money.<br /><br />Latinamerican films need to make a change but in a uplifting way. And I don't mean happy endings. But stories that most people can identify with and enjoy more at the same time.<br /><br />Also if I ever do any movie, this a good one to watch what not to do.<br /><br />Over and Out. Until next time.<br /><br />Thanks.\n",

            "I came to this movie expecting a peek into the genius of Gregg Toland, having been a long time fan of Citizen Kane. I was not disappointed at all, the cinematography is excellent throughout, even if the pacing of the movie and its subject make it quite dull. The main problem is that Hollywood had little experience with focusing on a group rather than on a single character, so Ford's attempt is indeed laudable. A year later in Stagecoach he tried something similar but the action was much more focused on the Ringo-Dallas story. In The Grapes of Wrath the story is much more coherent, having been made after a novel not after a series of plays (even if splendidly adapted by Dudley Nichols). Much of the story seems to be too contrived, I mean how lonesome did those seafarers did get at sea that they behaved so erratically when they were ashore? I think for a modern audience the best things in the movie come from Toland (the movie really looks good, the guy truly had the eye of a painter) and for Wayne who is not necessarily great in his impersonation of a Sweede as he ain't holdin' a gun in his hand and he ain't chassin' no Apache or Comanche but he's doing a good job still.<br /><br />My favorite images are near the end when the sailors are drunk and they're looking for Ole, the lighting and camera angles produce an uncanny atmosphere that combines very well with the puzzling state the drunken men must be in. The first shot of the movie is also brilliant and if it wouldn't have been directed by Ford I could have imagined something surreal about it. Much of the movie actually reminded me of Querelle, Fassbinder's last film, a surreal story about the hardships of sailing.\n",

At a small garage, Courtney spots the guy who predictably will later become her love interest. Upon paying for their goods, their credit card is declined, and you know from that point on that this entire movie is going to be predictable. Within 25 minutes we are introduced the customary `best friend', in the form of an adorable dog, whom it is decided is a stray, with no apparent regard for any owner it may have been fortunate to have. Enter Sam's new neighbour, `Gil', played by Billy Kay. It is instantly apparent that he is a troublemaker. He has a the stereotypical pierced ear of all young hoodlums. What follows is a feeble attempt at their bullying of Sam, followed by a feigned friendship in the hope of becoming closer to the beautiful Courtney. We also meet an elderly and slightly eccentric lady with a pie to greet the family. What follows is a tired, formulaic tale of a boy, his bullies and his ever faithful dog. `Earring boy', picks on Sam, is chased away by the dog, which looks for all the world like it will lick him death. Father of \"earring bully\" decides \"I don't want you hangin' round new kid\"...shortly after this point we learn that his mother died...father raises him alone...blah...blah. The scene of them climbing the fence, with \"scared fat kid being scared\" may well have been stolen from Stand By Me... The fairground scene equally predictable and nauseating as we see the \"romantic interest\" blossom, while bad kids steal fireworks, and you just know \"sumthin' bad is gonna happen\" There's even a \"bridge crossing\" reminiscent of SBM, at which point \"bad earring boy\" falls into lake, is naturally saved by boy, just before they all go over the waterfall that wasn't there 2 minutes ago, and the dog has disappeared only to make the customary reappearance at the end of the film when everything turns out happily ever after, the good and bad all become friends, and while playing chess (the way new best buddies always do), along comes baddies daddy, with a peace offering, and a hearty welcome and along comes doggie to be greeted with absolutely no emotion by kid, and they all lived happily ever after. From start to finish, this film is tired and predictable. Even the usually outstanding Paul Franklin Dano and Billy Kay cannot pull this film into life, as the scripting and direction are appalling. This is bland, predictable and formulaic. It is a genuine torture to watch. There are thousands of movie's in this genre, and nearly all do a much better job. If you're looking for a decent `sappy' family film, look elsewhere. Lassie, with Tom Guiry, is a much more enjoyable film, and while as predictable as most of these films are, is at least played out with some passion and enthusiasm. This film draws heavily on stereotypes, religious beliefs, and family values, in a lame attempt to cobble something remotely resembling a story. By the end of the film, the only thing more tired than myself was the film itself. Good points? It's a rather nice dog. Most definitely not recommended viewing; A total disappointment from start to finish.<br /><br />Ollie<br /><br />\n",

            "James Dunn had been a personable leading man for Fox in the early 30s but by the 40s alcohol had taken a grip and he was almost unemployable. He still managed to make movies (his big comeback was as the heart- breaking Johnny Nolan in \"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\") and he always remained likable. This was the last film for his leading lady, Florence Rice. After this film she moved on to radio and television. She was always the romantic interest - her roles were never meaty but she was pretty and wholesome and was often teamed with Robert Young.<br /><br />Webster (James Dunn) and Jackie Frye (Florence Rice) are newly weds (although they don't act like it) and decide to spend their honeymoon at an old country farmhouse, which is to be their home. Webster is not too keen but Jackie has enthusiasm for both. They are accompanied by their chauffeur Harmony (Sam McDaniells) who thinks that milk comes from the milkman. The farm is giving Webster the heebie jeebies - there is a man tying a noose to a tree, bullet holes in the doors, a coffin is delivered and a group of strangers turn up. One has a nervous habit of crossing and uncrossing his fingers - add to the mix a policeman who writes detective stories for a pulp magazine and you have an interesting group of characters. Nothing is done to develop them, the group turn out to be a notorious gang of jewel thieves. Webster masquerades as Bobo Hutch from Pittsburg, to infiltrate the gang - but in the next scene that is forgotten about. The most entertaining part is the man who comes to the door at the end to tell the harassed pair they are at the wrong house!!!!\n",

            "On the face of it,a team of police officers going undercover in a local firm together evidence and one of them getting the buzz for the violence is a good idea.<br /><br />Put into practice by this film, the idea is completely wasted.<br /><br />Having read some of the comments about this film ie how it shows what goes on at an unfashionable London club proves how such a badly researched film can be dangerous in giving a false idea of football and it's followers, well or badly behaved.<br /><br />I support an unfashionable London club and can say that even in the really bad old days it was nothing like this. I thought Green Street was a bad enough inaccurate portrayal but this pushed the limits of belief just too far.<br /><br />The \"firm\" just didn't look the part, and the scenes in the pub were just surreal to be polite. What on earth was going on with the fire eater? And who wrote the chants? Why not just use real chants? We are expected to believe that one of the under covers lives on the manor with a wife in the police who goes to work from home in uniform? Is he going to make such a mistake that his thug mates are not going to see this or pop round unexpectedly? The film is so full of holes it is incredible. I can't believe some think this is so true to life! Whoever researched this appears to have just read Daily Mail type exaggerated reports to scare middle England and used that as their ideas of how it is or was. Well it is and never was anything like this.<br /><br />The film is absolute junk and not worth the talents of some of the people in it.\n",

            "I picked this up in a cheap DVD bin. I immediately recognized as 1 of 2 movies that I saw when I was a starving (pretty much literally) student living away from home for the first time, in 1973, and couldn't resist picking it up and giving it a look, that many years later.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the promotion for the movie is pretty, ahem, imaginative. There's not a lot of sex (hardly any, actually), very little nudity, any reference to homosexuality is passing and irrelevant, there is no horror other than the horror of murder and violent death by knife and gun (we need more???), and it is not oriented towards the supernatural beyond the fact that the villains dabble in black masses -- there are no otherworldly events, no actual contact with the devil a la Rosemary's Baby or Devil's Advocate.<br /><br />So it's really a detective story. The device of tracking parallel time-lines does add some suspense and tension (exactly what did happen to this girl, and will the detective crack the case); however, I found that the tension peaked somewhere around mid-movie, and the trip to the end more or less plodded to anti-climatic conclusions to both time-lines.<br /><br />Unrealistic (as I imagine them) scenes certainly contributed to that plodding effect. At one point, amidst wild gunfire, a uniformed policeman tells the arriving detective, \"he's up there and he's got one of our men as hostage\", and then resumes shooting in the general direction. Uh, yea.<br /><br />Now, there are unexpected pleasures to be wrought from watching obscure movies now and then, and while I generally am pretty resistant to the 'oh wow, I've been there' effect, I did find the 1972 vintage shots of 'Place Jacques Cartier' and 'Rue St. Paul Est', well before the resurrection of the area as \"Old Montreal' to be such a surprise.\n",

            "Wow, that was awful! My fiancée(who has aided me in several other recent reviews of mine) and I watched this last night, and the quality was so low, we decided to write a review of it together... to warn off anyone lucky enough to not have watched it yet. No, the \"documentary\"-maker may not have had a direct hand in creating(nay, *spawning*) this episode, but it sure reeks of him. The story was preachy and condescending, not to mention poorly structured(essentially entirely built up around the political agenda that it forces upon us for a good deal of it). Another trait that fits with him having made it is the blatant anti-Americanism. No matter your stance in politics, no matter how you feel about the agenda pushed here, the presentation is undeniably extremely poor... which is really the very core of the problem with this. The message was heavy-handed, preachy(*at* you, not even to you) and insulting. This made After School Specials look subtle and Jerry Springers' Final Thought look intelligent. It's not so much Masters of Science Fiction as Masters, if even that, of Left Wing Propaganda. The acting was unimpressive, save for perhaps O'Quinn(whose presence in the episode, coupled with our attraction to the genre of science fiction were largely the reasons we watched the episode), but Rohm, for example, is just... bad. Why she keeps being cast is a mystery. Editing was OK, cinematography had moments that made me wish the director would pursue music videos, instead. The special effects seemed as if they wanted to save any money they could... save for one effect, which was good, and another, which seemed to have no purpose at all. The writing is quite lousy... clichés are plentiful, it was drenched in naivety, predictability abounds, the story never really captivates(in spite of its title, I could easily see people falling asleep during it), even though it manages to rip off far more established sci-fi titles(including Independence Day and The Day The Earth Stood Still... the latter being from when obvious messages in this genre were at least more accepted and usual, and actually a well-produced piece of celluloid; this was simplistic, offensive... modern propaganda). The writer/director seems to have also taken a note from X-Files(in addition to promoting The Cigarette Smoking Man to President), in leaving the ending open(to appease and appeal to both religious people and UFO enthusiasts... and here's hoping they'll all see right through it). The score was... strange. I'm not sure who thought those drums were a good idea. The production values aren't dreadful. The President and Americans, particularly military officials, all come off as war-mongers(the throwaway line about the fallout, oh *please*). The good guys are all the other countries, in this piece of pap. How was this even sci-fi? Heck, it could easily be argued that there is nothing that would bring about that classification to be found at all. Ignore the promos. Please. For your own good. And these are the \"masters\"? These episodes, the cream of the crop(since they were the ones ABC *chose* to air, there were two they didn'twhat must they have been like)? Somehow, early parts aren't devoid of promise... the first scene with O'Quinn actually has some dialog and points that were interesting, and the first episode, \"A Clean Escape,\" did at least show some quality to it. The only value this has is to be laughed at. We want our hour back. It should be noted that we only got to see these first two episodes, as our local ABC affiliate chose to air pre-season football instead of the two episodes following it... and ABC buried it in a spot in the summer, when they would be watched by hardly anyone. I recommend this only to those who agree with the message being shoved down the throats of viewers... so the preaching can go no further than the ears of the choir... and those who are fans of science fiction and/or Terry O'Quinn should especially stay away. Far, far away. And to the people behind this sorry excuse for entertainment and/or commentary: Guys... get on a soap-box and stay away from this fine medium(or, as my fiancée suggested, stick to message boards, so you can be put on Ignore). We don't need more sci-fi *this* badly. In case you were wondering if my fiancée and I hated this... yes. Yes, we did. We wish we could give this a zero, but... 1/10\n",

If masters make their art look easy then this is a great example of modern film mastery. Takeshi's shots and dialogue appear so simple and natural that you would begin to believe you could do it yourself with a camera, a beach and a handful of actors. Its unlike anything i have ever seen before, and the soundtrack from Joe Hisaishi compliments the film perfectly. Takeshi's slow, lingering, minimal style could put off some viewers, but if you don't mind the more contemplative camera then you have struck gold.<br /><br />\n",

            "Whit Stillman's movies are dialogue driven, which is not everyone's cup of tea. This is the first of a trilogy, all of which take a slice of life of young people coming of age, but in the cusp of a dying culture, with a new order and new responsibilities baring down on them. Here it's the prep and prom culture of New York's Upper East Side, sometime in the 70's. The participants dutifully go through the rights of Christmas Balls and 'orgy' week, act sophisticated, and generally do things and say things which are expected of them. An outsider, Tom, with radical social and intellectual ideas, enters their midst and becomes a catalyst of change here as a romance develops with Audrey. Tom, idealistic, insensitive and naive is embraced by Audrey, emotionally more mature but more vulnerable, accepting his sometimes preposterous social and literary speculation as a sign of substance in comparison to the increasingly jaded and cynical world of her preppy friends. A friendship develops also between Tom and Nick, the most cynical and pessimistic, but also the most aware and responsible, of the group. The conversations are lively and filled with insights into character and maturity. Nothing much happens in this film, but the intricate interplay of characters, dialogue and ambiance make for a fascinating and penetrating look at these young people's lives. It unfolds like a ballet. This is a fine film which doesn't rely on angst or melodrama-- and maintains a humor, poignancy and charm which makes it a rare achievement for the genre. Stillman's other two films in the trilogy are also highly recommended.\n",

            "Detractors may highlight the unnecessary violence in this stylish piece of film-making. But pay them no attention. N. Refn's 2nd feature is cutting it pretty close when it comes to assessing life's terrible lessons.<br /><br />Using almost the same cast as he did in his debut (Pusher), Bleeder tells the story of how a father-to-be deals with his impending fate. It addresses his current state of mind, his readjustment of values and how all this would adversely affect the people around him. The violence is necessary as the characters emanate from the streets and one can only infer, from the several scenes, that the neighbourhood is rough and littered with gangs and racial tension.<br /><br />There is also a secondary story about the budding relationship between a video store clerk and a well-read waitress which is as sweet as it is subtle. It's interesting to note that their tastes in videos and books are pretty gritty as well.\n",

            "This movie is literally all over the place. Aliens decide to invade earth by employing astro-zombies which run around on a rampage, unconvincingly hacking and slashing people just sitting around, basically waiting to get killed. A woman reporter (Brinke Stevens) is on the scene, as well as her boyfriend who works for the CIA (and looks about half her age), an FBI agent, plus there's some crazy 70+ Joan Collins-looking woman who insists on showing marks on her breast (Aaaak!) whenever she claims she was abducted by aliens, then there's some George Carlin-lookalike doctor who teams up with a psychic or something, plus Tura Satana (from the first Astro-Zombies movie) and her dimwit henchman who looks like Vincent D'Onofrio from MEN IN BLACK who hope to cash in on the invasion. On top of this, there's plenty of random scenes of government officials sitting around a table saying vaguely important things, plus some \"doctors\" chillin' in an E.R., and John Carradine's head kept alive in a lab.<br /><br />With so many characters and so much stuff going on, this movie is totally out of control! If I had any clue as to what was going on, I might have enjoyed it in other ways, but as it is this movie is purely for laughs. Mikels certainly has improved his style since the 60's in that his newer films are much more briskly-paced, more entertaining, and action-packed (he has a funny cameo which cleverly incorporates his earlier cameos). The special effects (including some pretty decent CGI) range from laughably terrible to surprisingly good. The acting, on the other hand, is all-round abysmal with the sole exception of the only real actor in the movie, Brinke Stevens (who looks quite good in that short skirt of hers).<br /><br />The problem with the movie though is that it takes itself too seriously when it's obvious it benefitted the most from the unintentional comedy. The scenes of zombies running around various industrial areas and hacking people are totally hilarious indeed, but sandwiched between too many random scenes of talking heads. The film then seems to randomly cut back and forth between the many subplots, and the same zombie keeps waking up in the alien spaceship a total of about five times. Even sillier is how so much of the actors' screaming is obviously ADR, so much clearer than the regular dialog, which is often either muffled or rendered inaudible due to the constant loud music. Only the scenes involving Satana seem to be intentionally funny. <br /><br />I don't know how to sum this one down - it felt like I sat through 8 movies at once; bewildering, confusing, laughable, yet somehow very entertaining. It has a great beginning, ending, and some scenes in the middle, which is the best one can really expect for a movie obviously shot with no money but a lot of enthusiasm.<br /><br />Much better than the first film, which was 88 minutes of characters standing around explaining to each other how the Astro-Zombies work, and 2 minutes of killin'. This one's more like 20 minutes of killing, 20 minutes of aliens, and 30 minutes of characters talking to each other and looking confused, then 15 minutes of cars driving around and various other random stuff.<br /><br />Too bad MST3K missed out on this one - it's ten times funnier by itself than most of their better episodes.\n",

            "Ring and Ring 2's ability to terrify an audience relied strongly on the fact that the TV you were watching them on was a possible portal for the video-curse and even Sadako herself. Not that anyone would really believe Sadako would come out of your TV, but subconsciously it must have an effect. In Ring 0 - Birthday, there are no cursed videos and no televisions. Instead, '0' takes us back 30 years before the original Ring, to where Sadako is an apprentice for a theatre company. What we quickly learn is that Sadako is not a monstrous psychic-killer that springs from household appliances but a shy, troubled young woman with a secret past. Those familiar with the Ring films will know that Sadako 'killed' a mocking reporter at her mother's para-psychological demonstration after he accused the psychic of being a fraud. The fiancé of this reporter sets about investigating what went on and tracks down Sadako at the theatre, convinced that she is responsible in some way for her fiancé's death.<br /><br />The theatre troupe has a bad feeling about Sadako, as most of them have been experiencing the same disturbing dream about her, where they see her next to a well, and a certain air of doom has clouded the theatre since her arrival. When the lead actress in the play dies, killed by a younger Sadako (who is more like the ghoul from the first two films - it's confusing, but things are explained later), Sadako is given her role, much to the distress and suspicion of her fellow actors. The appearance of the 'dark' Sadako coincides with a strange noise played from a reel-to-reel tape recorder used by the theatre to play music. This, it seems, is how Sadako's dark power is unleashed, much like the videotape of the originals. But the older Sadako does not initiate any of the terror unleashed, and it is only a matter of time before the troupe accuses her of being a killer, whereas in reality she possesses the power to heal. Questions arise throughout the film, and are frequently answered, like why are two Sadako's, of different ages, walking around in the theatre? Yes, this question is answered, but not here in this review. Ring 0 is much more character based than the two previous films, getting into the head of the tragic Sadako by means of flashbacks and a subtle love story that shows she is a decent, vulnerable human being. At first it is slightly confusing as you are not sure whether you are watching the Sadako that will turn into the deformed, freakish ghoul that crawls out of TV screens to scare people to death. But it is knowing who she ends up to be that gives the film an air of tragedy as this misunderstood and innocent girl is hunted like a beast and forced to become one with her evil side. To say any more about the story would inevitably spoil it so I'll go no further, but for those worried about a lack of an 'evil' Sadako, don't worry. She's there too.<br /><br />Visually, Ring 0 is a much more lavish, expensive-looking production than its predecessors that relied on dark, gritty camera-work and realistic lighting to enhance the 'normal' and make the story more believable. With '0' the style is more polished, with swooping camera moves and clearer, more stylised lighting. This works, as the film is more layered than Ring, whose visuals suited its single-minded determination to scare you witless. Instead here we have a production just as interested in characterisation and story whilst also being very, very scary in places, which is helped by the excellent photography and set design.<br /><br />The acting is first rate, especially from Yukie Nakama who gives a subtle performance as Sadako, and everyone else is on form. The only let down is some of the terrible screaming going on here - remember the castle of 'Aaarrrrggggghhhhhh' from Monty Python and the Holy Grail? Well, people die whilst omitting these terrible, comedy death-groans that really do steal from the tension and give you a mental picture of Graham Chapman in chain mail. Apart from that, I don't think '0' could be a better film.<br /><br />Director Norio Tsuruta delivers a consistent, suspenseful shocker with plenty of visual flourishes and interesting ideas. It's easy to think that, in the wrong hands, Sadako could have been turned into a Freddy/Jason-style stalker walking amongst the shadows willing people to death, but instead we have an entertaining character piece with plenty of frights and chills spliced in for good measure.<br /><br />Ring 0 surprised me. It is a more solid film than the original, more layered and ultimately more rewarding. But what it lacks is the pure, raw fear of the original that made it so memorable, and it wouldn't work without seeing the original first. Better and scarier than 2, quite possibly on a par with the first. And if you thought Sadako couldn't be scarier than when she crawled out of the TV in Ring, sit tight - because Sadako's still got a few tricks up her elongated sleeve, including a finale that will have people of a nervous disposition reaching for the 'off' button on their remote control.<br /><br />If you're a Ring fan, you've got to see this. If you've never seen them you won't get it. If you've seen them and didn't like them, still give this one a try as it's a completely different experience altogether.\n",

            "This film has been unavailable for so many years, so to finally have it on DVD is great. It is an unusual film noir from Otto Preminger and his favorite leading lady, Gene Tierney, who had starred in his classic \"Laura\" and whom had just completed her maternity leave when production began on \"Whirlpool\".<br /><br />Tierney gives a fascinating performance as Ann Sutton, the beautiful wife of a prominent psychiatrist (Richard Conte) who suffers from kleptomania but who will do anything to conceal this. When hypnotist David Korvo (Jose Ferrer, very menacing here), gets her out of a jam with the local authorities due to her shoplifting tendencies, he decides to use it as a form of blackmail against her in order to use his hypnotizing skills on her. He gets her to perform all kinds of shady deeds, while succeeding in getting her conscious mind to suppress it. She is strangely drawn to him, while her dumbfounded husband can come to only one conclusion - that she and Korvo are involved in an illicit affair. Ann desperately tries to prove her innocence, and in the process, leads all involved in a potentially deadly trap to stop Korvo.<br /><br />There are echoes of \"Laura\" throughout, including the portrait that hangs over the mantle at the home of the ill-fated Theresa Randolph (Barbara O'Neill, best remembered as Scarlett's mother in GWTW), and the final shootout. Definitely an off-beat movie of the noir genre, it is still a very watchable one. Richard Conte is a little unconvincing as Tierney's shrink husband, but he manages to pull it off, with efficient support from Tierney and Ferrer.<br /><br />Can a man make a woman do things she doesn't want to do? Watch \"Whirlpool\" and draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />A great addition to the Fox Film Noir collection.\n",

            "I seem to recall being warned about this one in advance to count it among Bela Lugosi's worst films! Anyhow, my viewing pleasure with this film (if there was any to be had in the first place) was seriously hampered by the atrocious video/audio quality of the print I watched (which seems to come off of a TV recording), replete with missing frames (shortening its running time by about 6 minutes!) and practically looking as if it was shot in the 1900s or something! Still, I suppose with the proper script and performers this could have made for a decent Thin Man/Charlie Chan outing; as it is, it's merely dull with a capital D and fatally cliché-ridden. Lugosi fared much better in the similarly-themed INTERNATIONAL HOUSE (1933) which was a most pleasant surprise for me when I caught up with it late last year via Universal's W.C. Fields DVD set.\n",

            "Another childhood memory raped and murdered...<br /><br />Why why why must the Industry rely on reinventing classics instead of creating worthy original material? This live-action retelling of the classic 70s Rankin-Bass stop-motion holiday hit The Year Without a Santa Claus (itself based upon a book by Phyllis McGinley) makes the same mistakes as the live-action \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" movie starring Jim Carrey did in 2000. You just *can't* take a classic and drag it out to feature length! The updated \"Year Without a Santa Claus\" did not need to be two hours long, nor did it need to be updated *at all*. Even the acting talents of John Goodman, Delta Burke and Carol Kane couldn't save this train wreck of an idea.<br /><br />Fans of the original--you'll be disappointed. It drags, it changes the story, it has *Chris Kattan* and too many topical references that will make it look dated and quite stupid in years to come, whereas the original has remained timeless.<br /><br />Stick with the original.\n",

That I can put up with, but not the vast amount of \"darlings\" uttered by \"Jane\" (Maureen O'Sullivan). That gets really annoying<br /><br />However, the rest of the film is very entertaining, very good and even very clever at times.

            "First, just for the record, this film did not rip off 'The Matrix'. It came out a year earlier. Such arguments seem pointless to me anyway, since the basic premise both of these movies, plus 'The Thirteenth Floor', 'The Truman Show', 'Pleasantville', et al are so blatantly appropriated from Philip K Dick's SF of the 1950's. <br /><br />Never mind that, though. This is another \"What is reality\" film (a question Dick apparently used to pose himself every morning); this time the variation being that an alien race has abducted a city of humans and is performing experiments on them to try to find out the nature of the human soul. That isn't a spoiler, BTW. In fact the very first thing that happens in this film is that the narrator tells you what I just told you. You can't help but wonder if it might have served to achieve a better sense of mystery if they hadn't thought to lay that on you in the first 30 seconds, but the film manages to be quite suspenseful all the same.<br /><br />'Dark City' is directed by the bloke who brought us 'The Crow', which I thought was utter rubbish. It has a similar dark, stylised look, which will probably appeal to goths - but in 'Dark City' there is at least a reason for this perpetual night. <br /><br />'Dark City' is SF, nominally, but the kernel of hard SF which mostly emerges (quite pleasingly) at the end of the movie is subsumed by the complete stylization of the movie's visual elements. There really isn't any need for the aliens to all look and talk like Riff-Raff from 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show', for the scary, gruesome, dark sets - for the fact that people are driving 1960's cars around and wearing 1940's fashions. There is no need to have an evil little kid alien, or for the aliens to all chatter their teeth when they do something ominous. You have got get over the silliness of this sort of stuff and appreciate that it's just part of the weird, atmospheric world the director has created. Really it all owes as much to comic book horror and super-hero stuff as it does to traditional science fiction.<br /><br />'Dark City' is the sort of film which can easily annoy you if you allow it to, but if you can forgive its affectations and the fact that it doesn't even attempt to explain various obvious logical oddities (e.g. why don't people who collapse face-first in a bowl of porridge drown after a few hours?) then the film can win you over as the hero goes through his version of taking the red pill (or was it the blue one? I always forget.)<br /><br />This film also raises several important questions about Kiefer Sutherland. How come his glasses don't fall off when he's hanging upside down? Why does he speak haltingly, stutteringly, EXCEPT when he's stressed out? Did he just get this job because his dad knew the producer? Fortunately Sutherland's typically ridiculous acting is balanced to an extent by William Hurt as Inspector Bumstead (honestly!) - the cop who's chasing after the hero. Hurt is, as always, almost completely devoid of personality, and looks as if he's in a trance most of the time. Of course he's always like this, but in this movie it actually makes sense.<br /><br />Rufus Sewell is fine as the hero - the guy who 'wakes up' - and so is Jennifer Connelly as his 'wife'. The aliens are all over the top and silly, and they float through the air and chatter their teeth, but like I said, you have to just think comic-book, and you can forgive it all.<br /><br />In some ways 'Dark City' is a film that I hate myself for liking, but the truth is it's a pretty darn effective, if somewhat ridiculous SF story, and what makes it work are precisely the things that make it silly. Go figure. 7 out of 10.\n",

            "As incredible as it seems, the only one of the \"Beverly Hills Cop\" trilogy I'd seen before the other night was the second one which I've seen more times than I'd care to admit. The original has completely passed me by but if it's as bad as this one then I think I'll give it a miss. If ever a film typified the Eighties and the flash-bang appeal of producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer then, for me anyway, \"Beverly Hills Cop 2\" is it but this tired addition to the series has none of the charm or style of the early films. Only Eddie Murphy and Judge \"Will Work For Food\" Reinhold were daft enough to sell their souls for the sake of this disappointing drudgery.<br /><br />Murphy returns as Detroit maverick Axel Foley, who is on the trail on the man who gunned his boss down. After a raid on a chop shop ends in the death of Inspector Todd (Gil Hill), a distraught Foley chases the perps to Beverly Hills following his only lead to the distinctly Disney-ish Wonder World theme park. Teaming up once again with his old buddy Rosewood (Reinhold) and his new partner (Hector Elizondo), they track down a group of security guards at the park led by the popular Ellis De Wald (Timothy Carhart). De Wald secretly leads a complex money printing scheme within the park and Foley, still seeking revenge for Tood's death, defies the wishes of the FBI and goes after him in his own, unique way.<br /><br />Depending on how much you like Eddie Murphy's wide-mouthed shouting and screaming, there isn't a great deal to like about \"Beverly Hills Cop 3\". Murphy feels out-of-sorts while Reinhold still has the wide-eyed look of someone who is surprised that they're acting in a film at all. The comedy, when it comes, is forced and weak - the bizarre reappearance of the hideously annoying Serge (Bronson Pinchot) signals the sheer desperation of the writers. The plot is so weak that it's difficult to imagine how they sustained it for as long as they did. Remember how Foley tackled heavily armed and highly professional bank robbers in the second film? Here, he faces disgruntled security guards at a theme park. The life and joy of the earlier films is replaced with a lethargic laziness in all areas - acting, story, action, even the predictable romance with the park attendant (Theresa Randle) feels tacked on at the last minute. Throw in some pointless cameos - the most noticeable and enjoyable by George Lucas - and the whole thing feels as fake and tasteless as plastic fruit.<br /><br />Murphy has displayed an erratic choice of movies throughout his career but this is one of the worst. All it does is make you wish you were watching the earlier films or maybe something like \"Bad Boys\". Whereas \"Bad Boys\" is the true successor to the earlier \"Beverly Hills Cop\" films due to its heavily stylish look and comedic approach to the cop genre, this is tired and rehashed filler. Even the classic synthesiser theme music has been mangled, which shouldn't be surprising but it is disappointing. It feels as if it wants to be a restart for the series but it proves to be the death-knell. It badly misses the attention of producers Simpson & Bruckheimer and even Murphy looks like he's not that bothered. Basically, don't even think about watching this unless you wish to watch the whole series in one sitting. But quite frankly, why would you?\n",

Tierney is the wife of a successful psychiatrist who is caught shoplifting. She is helped by Ferrer, a hypnotist who steps in during her interrogation. He works with her to help her solve some of her problems, but he adds some other hypnosis as well.<br /><br />This isn't a great Preminger. The acting is good, but the script is weak. First of all, is it really possible to hypnotize someone that completely? I don't know. What I do know is that it's absolutely against all ethics to talk about a patient with anyone as freely as Conte does. Since a good deal of the plot hinges on his breaking of that doctor-patient privilege, the story doesn't hold up.<br /><br />Gene Tierney is her usual beautiful self. This is not, however, a role that plays to her strengths as an actress. She's sympathetic but doesn't explore the range of the role enough. She more easily played an icy or feisty type. In those days, as actresses neared 30, studios became less interested, and Tierney found herself in roles which she was not particularly right for - or that wasted her talent just to fulfill her contractual obligations. Ferrer is excellent as the oily hypnotist, keeping his voice even when he was saying the most outrageous things. Conte is very good as well as Tierney's husband.<br /><br />All in all, this was interesting to watch, but it could have been much better given the talent behind and before the camera.\n",

            "This film infuriated me enough that I'm not certain I can write sensibly about it. So forgive me if I begin to rant. The thing is, this movie blatantly rips off several movies that I love, including \"Harold And Maude,\" \"Pump Up The Volume,\" \"Some Kind Of Wonderful,\" \"Sixteen Candles,\" \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" and \"Rushmore.\" It is not an homage to these films. It's simple thievery. And not done by an adept thief, but by an amateur. Meaning the thievery doesn't even work.<br /><br />The song \"If You Want To Sing Out, Sing Out\" was written by Cat Stevens specifically for the film \"Harold And Maude\" (one of only two songs written for that film, the other being \"Don't Be Shy\"). In this film it's used twice, the first time as a duet on the piano, just as it's used the first time in \"Harold And Maude,\" which is annoying enough. But the second time, it doesn't fit at all. It's used to end a play - a play that is supposed to be controversial, by the way, but which clearly isn't - written by a student. So Gustin Nash has the student be a thief as well - this poor suicidal character (the suicide attempt, incidentally, is straight out of \"Pump Up The Volume,\" as is Charlie Bartlett's speech near the end and his subsequent arrest - in fact, as he is put into the back of the police car in slow motion, I couldn't help but turn to my friends and say \"Talk hard\"). So the play within the film ends with a song stolen from a much better film - but doesn't fit at all. Also, they didn't get the lyrics right, but that's insignificant when compared to the larger problems of this movie.<br /><br />If you do decide to see this film, I suggest a way to enjoy it: shout out the title of the movie each scene is stealing from. I'll give you a hint. When the movie begins - and I mean the second it starts - shout out, \"Rushmore.\" You'll be ahead of the game.<br /><br />The first scene is the first scene from \"Rushmore.\" A teenager's fantasy about standing in front of his peers, being successful and leading the way - and then getting shaken out of his reverie by a teacher. Actually, the first several scenes are from \"Rushmore.\" The boy gets kicked out of private school, ends up in public school, but still wears the blazer with the private school emblem on it.<br /><br />But Gustin Nash is not content to steal from just \"Harold And Maude\" and \"Rushmore.\" We're soon introduced to the bully from \"Some Kind Of Wonderful,\" and - surprise, surprise - he and the main character become friends. And he, like Elias Koteas in the better film, has hidden artistic talent. He can act. So, like in \"Rushmore,\" the bully is in the play at the end of the film. We also have the scene from \"Sixteen Candles\" where a couple leave a dance to go sit in the backseat of broken car within the building. Of course, before that we're treated to the school bus ride from \"Sixteen Candles.\" That reminds me. There is a school bus sign to let Charlie Bartlett know where to catch the bus, yet no one else gets on at that stop. So why was the sign there? Did the bus always stop there, even when there were no students? Or did they just put the sign up that day for him?<br /><br />Well, this movie is not the worst film I've ever seen. There is actually some good acting in it, especially by Kat Dennings as Susan, Charlie's love interest, and Tyler Hilton as the bully. And of course Hope Davis is always good. And Robert Downey Jr., an actor I love, does the best he can with the material - but he does fall flat in several scenes, particularly a horrible scene involving him waving a gun around next to his pool. I could go on for several pages about all that is wrong with that scene, but I won't. Because I hope by now I've convinced you to stay far away from this film. Don't let this amateur thief have a hit. Let him fade quietly away.\n",

Richter is boring and doesn't compare to Eubanks or any of Leno's crew.<br /><br />You literally have to be stupid to laugh at, or with, O'Brien. There is simply no depth, no insight. The worse part is that O'Brien is not even laugh-out-loud kind of stupid funny.

I had even predicted that he would do something about moving from NY to LA. A commentator on IMDb actually found that part funnier than Leno's monologue. Spare us your sense of humor, will ya? <br /><br />The obsession with the new set and the Universal lot is already getting lame. When O'Brien did the tour, you could notice that most people on the trams were bored out of their minds. His antics included emotional outbursts, making the tram go round and round, becoming scared by everything, and so on, none of which were even remotely funny. You could tell the laughter was mostly canned.<br /><br />Leno's monologue was funny - if it wasn't, Leno made it funny. Leno's face and expressions are funny. His jokes are intelligent.

            "It's 2009 and I have just watched the best television drama I have ever seen and it's called 'The Corner'. Having been a late comer to 'The Wire' series on the FX channel in Britain then when that finished they advertised 'The Corner'. I expected the standard ghetto junkie story but 'The Corner' has an emotional pull that hits you right in the guts. I watched the show with friends and everybody was glued to the screen and the room was in total silence during this drama. The acting was incredible and the characters stay with you forever. I can't remember the last time that I genuinely couldn't wait to see the next episode of a programme. In my opinion this show is a lot better than 'The Wire' because it has heart in almost every character and you are desperate to see life improve for them. The Corner deserves a DVD release & I'll be the first in line to buy it. The cast & crew should be very proud of making a modern masterpiece.\n",

            "I had tickets for this at the Toronto International Film Festival last summer but was side-tracked by an obscure little film called Slumdog Millionaire instead, so only got around to watching it last night on pay-per-view. In a strange way, the two films have a good deal in common. In an era in which everyone seems to want either tense thrillers, puerile comedies or awesome special effects (the only one here, as has been pointed out, is a cheaply put together tornado), both movies offer little more than a thoroughly improbable plot and a focus on character development. But both work remarkably well. I am puzzled by those who found that the movie dragged. While most of the plot development was telegraphed not once but several times, the acting from all three leads was both believable and very deft. At first I thought that Rachel McAdams' character was simply too naive to be true but it soon became apparent that she was much wiser than we (or even she) knew. She plays it beautifully. Tim Robbins is wonderful too, and rather pathetic, in a down-to-earth role as an aging war veteran, happy to have survived and soon to be confronted with some harsh realities. But Michael Pena was the real surprise. He is completely captivating in his portrayal of a proud young vet from a military family on his way to meet his girlfriend, with his masculinity compromised by a war injury. His character is the most subtly poignant as he confronts his own fears about his manhood, on several levels.<br /><br />Like all movies based on the Iraqi war, this seems to suffer from America's desire to ignore the war altogether, just as they ignored the Vietnam veterans a generation ago (Coming Home, The Deer Hunter). America seems to be much less willing to address its failures now than it was then, or even the lesser failures in the wake of World War II.\n",

The characterization, the depth of the plot, the sincerity of the human emotion in those stories are the among the finest to be found anywhere. Kabuliwala is another such great movie to be based on a Bengali story.<br /><br />Sharmila Tagore is superb, Vinod Mehra plays the grown up Nandu with great sincerity. Rajesh Khanna lends a lot of credibility to Anand-babu despite having turned a major superstar during the making of this movie. Om Prakash is always a pleasure to watch although his role is very small. R.D.Burman and Kishore Kumar top it all off with the great music!\n",

            "My wife is a HUGE Rick Springfield fan, so we watched this on Lifetime recently. I love B flicks as much as the next person, and this low budget romantic-thriller is as cheaply made as they come. Despite the Parisian setting, it's apparent that this was not made in France. All of the scenes featuring Paris landmarks are pretty much stock footage, but that's only a minor glitch in this predictable movie. The plot is fairly improbable: A scholar switches places with her fashion model twin and heads to Paris, then gets involved in mystery/romance/blackmail. I've never read a Harlequin novel, but am assuming that this is pretty much the standard formula. Surprisingly, the movie didn't even have any Rick Springfield music! Perhaps his songs were too expensive to use on the soundtrack. Who knows? It's bad stuff but perhaps Rick fans might enjoy.\n",

            "When a film that's had such a bad press as \"Buffy\" still manages to disappoint you, that's one bad film. For much of its running time it manages to be no worse than mediocre - a sort of sub-\"Clueless\" (which, to be fair, it predates by three years), with Kristy Swanson doing well enough as a sub-Alicia Silverstone. It also has much the same agenda as \"Clueless\" of taking a gentle poke at affluent society's rigid class system and wafer-thin \"caring about the environment\" values. Presumably Joss Whedon's script originally had rather more in this direction; it seems to be set up that Buffy and her class are vampires too, but nothing is done with this idea. <br /><br />\"Clueless\" had the advantage of a plot by Jane Austen. As soon as \"Buffy\"'s plot starts, things rapidly collapse. Disaster is staved off for a while by Swanson's energy, Donald Sutherland's ability to keep a straight face, and Paul Reuben's touching conviction that he's in a funny film. But never has Rutger Hauer's natural screen presence been so totally neutralized by poor direction, unfocused character design and a story that's not only increasingly incomprehensible but not even worth trying to follow. Again, there is an idea here: Whedon seems to want to posit a sort of eternal attraction between vampires and those who slay them, so that being the slayer according to the traditional rules simply confirms and strengthens the vampires' power. But it all goes for nothing. <br /><br />The fact that the themes and characters are so far removed from that of the spin-off series means that the movie doesn't actually suffer from comparisons with it. It just suffers from being rubbish. Kudos to Fox for being talked into taking on this botched project for a remarkable series, and, for that matter, for suggesting Sarah Michelle Gellar should play Buffy rather than Cordelia. Execs get a bad press, let's give them a moment's appreciation.\n",

Some may complain that this movie is too long and slow, but I would wager that their attention spans are somewhat lacking. If you are looking for a high action movie with robots then you have come to the wrong place. If you are looking for a sci-fi based romantic comedy about the personal growth of one man...er robot, then this is the movie. The comedy was well written and well played, appropriately placed in each moment. AS for the character of Andrew(Robin Williams), though he is supposed to be a robot you really connect with his character and sense his growth over time. Unlike A.I. his character learns and grows and has real not fabricated emotional attachments. I give this movie an 8 or 9. Very good.\n",

From there the movie takes you on a great mystical adventure in Neverland of Peter Pan re-finding himself and his youthful spirit, remembering his past, and rescuing his kids from the sinister Captain Hook. It is a wonderful story.<br /><br />The casting of Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman was great. Bob Hoskins is perfect for the role of Hook's right hand man Smee. John Williams of course conducts a masterful score. The child actors play their part very well. Steven Spielberg made this movie people, I don't see why you need to compare this movie's success to say 'Jaws' or 'ET'. Because Spielberg makes many great movies I understand that he has set a standard for himself, but just because this movie wasn't groundbreaking doesn't make it bad. It is a great movie in my opinion.<br /><br />This is my favorite movie of all time. I give it 10/10 without any reservations.\n",

Making it about anger management where Nicholson is a psychiatrist with a short temper himself and Sandler is his neurotic patient with repressed anger is a great premise.

It also seemed to be indecisive about what type of film it was trying to be and this weakened its calibur as well. As a huge fan of Sandler and Nicholson in a variety of genres I can appreciate a good turn-your-brain-off comedy as well as a more defined romantic comedy, but this one seemed to fall somewhere in between and it really didn't work.

            "Hands down this is the best film of the year, and deservingly so. Although Nikhil Advani started off in the backseat, it looks like from now on his job is in the director's chair. With the support of Karan Johar and Papa Yash Johar, it's almost impossible to go wrong. <br /><br />With such blockbusters as Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham to his name, Karan Johar is ready to add another feather to his cap with his beautiful and heartwarming Kal Ho Na Ho. Kal Ho Na Ho is directed by Karan Johar's associate director Nikhil Advani and produced by Karan Johar, who has also written the screenplay for the film. Nikhil Advani was Johar's close assistant in all his films including Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, K3G, and Aditya Chopra's Mohabbatein.. The main cast has Shah Rukh Khan, Preity Zinta, Saif Ali Khan and Jaya Bachchan in the lead, and a plethora of others, including Sonali Bendre, in support.<br /><br />Kal Ho Naa Ho takes place in Manhattan, New York, and is the story of three friends, Aman (Shah Rukh Khan), Rohit (Saif Ali Khan), and Naina (Preity Zinta), who travel on a journey that teaches them the true meaning of friendship. It teaches them to discover themselves, and to find the courage to live through times of happiness and times of sorrow. With the constant arguments and bickering in her semi-Punjabi/semi-Christian family, Naina, 23, is completely distraught by the conditions which surround her. In addition to this, she is bombarded with the responsibilities of taking care of her younger brother and sister, as well as helping her mother, Jennifer (Jaya Bachchan) handle the family's economical complications. Between all these burdens, Naina never has time for herself.<br /><br />As far as the technical performance of the film goes, it is almost impossible to create a more perfect film. The editing skills are extremely sound and the cinematography shows the viewers what a difference a few angle adjustments can do for a film. The overall effect of the film is merely jaw dropping, for a lack of a better term. To put all rumors to rest, Kal Ho Na Ho is NOT a copy of Hrikesh Mukherjee's 1970s classic, Anand. Although Nikhil and Karan have adopted a shade of the film, by no means is it a copy, and should be regarded as a purely original story, written by Karan himself.<br /><br />The greatest asset that Kal Ho Na Ho has is its cast. The magnitude of chemistry between Shah Rukh Khan, Preity Zinta, and Saif Ali Khan is mind blowing! Adding Jaya Bachchan to the mix creates for an even more awesome effect. It's safe to say that this is one of Shah Rukh Khan's best performances ever. He breathes so much life into his character, Aman, and literally has you feeling for him as if he was your very own. He puts on a mesmerizing performance and will definitely earn himself many awards.<br /><br />Shankar, Ehsaan, and Loy are a major part of this film as well. There music, which has been topping the charts ever since its release, brings a beautiful touch to the film. Their soft yet mellifluous melodies compliment the film wonderfully. To top it all off, Javed Akhtar's mastery of the language creates for some heart warming lyrics.\n",

He falls in love when he least expects it, finds friends in a very unlikely group, and manages to keep going despite the circumstances.<br /><br />This is a wonderful farce that happens to contain some really talented actors. Most notably Liam Neeson, who has been seen most recently as Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars: Episode I (1999). He plays Charlie, an undercover DEA agent who is going through a nervous breakdown. Oliver Platt who most recently caught my attention as Hector Cyr, an eccentric expert on crocodiles in Lake Placid (1999). Oliver plays Fulvio, the son-in-law of Italian Mobster Don Carmine Minetti. Sandra Bullock plays Judy Tipp, a nurse who takes ailing Charlie under her wing. Honorable mention in the movie goes to Mitch Pileggi, who does an excellent job portraying the somewhat shallow character of Dexter Helvenshaw, one of Charlie's superiors.<br /><br />I must say I had never heard of director/writer Eric Blakeney. He has a great wit, lets hope he produces more. I found many scenes in this movie very compelling. One in the middle of the movie stands out.<br /><br />Fulvio (Oliver Platt) comes home after a particularly stressful confrontation and enters the dingy, cluttered kitchen of the home he shares with his wife, Gloria. They are not having a good time of it and she angrily tells him he better shape up. She storms off and you expect him to blow up. He has that mad gleam in his eyes. He seizes a knife... ...and then throws it in the sink and starts cleaning the kitchen frantically, not stopping until it is spotless. Priceless.\n",

            "This is just amazing, quite unlike any other \"american\" film I ever saw; a gentle, bittersweet tale of frustrated dreams and artistic integrity, an hilarious comedy of manners performed by an outstanding international cast, a touching blend of awkward romance and the central relationship between the two brothers, brilliantly portrayed by co-creator Tucci and Hollywood's \"every-foreigner\", the sublime Tony Shalhoub. Big Night dragged me through wider range of emotions than any other movie, it made me want to dance and sing during the party scene (Mambo Italiano), made me laugh out loud at the wacky characters sprinkled throughout, made me angry with the philistines and money-grabbing capitalists who spoil the brothers' dream, made me want to hug Shalhoub's shy gastronomic genius Primo as he tried so clumsily to chat up his flower-girl; the food looked simply amazing, Minnie Driver splashing around in the sea was at her most gorgeous, every actor played their brilliantly scripted part to perfection and the scene at the end with the omelette is the most beautiful and poignant ending I could ever hope to see. All in all this film is one of the best ever made and everyone in the world and especially in Hollywood should be forced to watch it every week until they get some humanity back in them. But not on an empty stomache, get some snacks in first eh.\n",

            "Cabaret was far different that the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical films like The Sound of Music or Mary Poppins or Oklahoma. This film was decadent for the time of Berlin before Hitler's rise to power. As the Nazi movement was gaining power, Berlin residents like Sally Bowles played by the one and only Liza Minnelli had relationships with men and lived on her singing at nightclubs until she meets Michael York (When will he be knighted?) anyway he plays the writer. Joel Grey won an Oscar as the Maestro. I loved the movie and won't bother to see the musical whether it's Judi Dench or anybody else playing Sally Bowles. THere was only one person who played Sally Bowles to me and that was the divine Liza with a Z. She totally becomes the character. When you see this film version, any musical whether the West End in London or Broadway in New York City will always be second rate to this cast. Of course, the fact that Bob Fosse directed this gem and changed the musical films forever from light and happy to dark and sad like in Cabaret. It's eerie to think that the people in the Cabaret have no idea of the horror that lies ahead with World War II and that's terrifying in general. I won't give away much but that this is Liza at her finest and best.\n",

            "Is the Dice-Man funny? No.<br /><br />Funny enough to warrant an in-concert movie? Definitely not.<br /><br />And this is the movie that proves it.<br /><br />\"Dice Rules\" is one of the absolute lowest points in American motion pictures since they decided to let Burgess Meredith do a nude scene in \"Such Good Friends\". But at least THAT was funny.<br /><br />Andrew \"Dice\" Clay has been called a lot of things in his life, I'm sure, but when he was called \"a comedian\", I'm also sure that was said with condescending laughter, snickers and Bronx cheers aplenty.<br /><br />Nothing he says here is funny, nothing he does here is funny, and the only debatable part of this whole self-destructive exercise was watching him get beaten up and verbally abused by every person he comes across in that little opening film he did before the concert starts.<br /><br />He overcame though, darn it.<br /><br />And the material (if that's what you can call it) is basically picking on the handicapped, the elderly, birds (yeah, you heard me), sexual practices, homosexuals and women. Oh, those poor women. What he says about women here should get him 20 to life for verbal rape.<br /><br />The fact that an entire auditorium full of people (Madison Square Garden!) cheered and laughed with him. This is a sick, SICK world we live in.<br /><br />Look, similar material has been done by the likes of Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy and even Sam Kinison but they all had a grace, they knew the moves as well as the music. Dice is tone deaf. He has no grace, no talent and not one respectful bone in his big, lumbering body. This entire film smacks of desperation. If you have the misfortune to watch it, you'll no doubt agree.<br /><br />Don't roll this \"Dice\"; it'll come up snake eyes.<br /><br />No stars, none whatsoever. If they ever decide to do the reprogramming like they did in \"A Clockwork Orange\", I elect Clay.<br /><br />Now THAT would be something I'd pay to see.\n",

            "Hey, don't you think it's kind of odd that someone would stab themselves in the chest with a flick knife and then bury themselves? <br /><br />If your answer to the above question is \"I agree\", then you could have been, or may well be part of the team of monkeys that came up with the idea for, wrote and cast this movie. It's a huge shame that stuff like this gets made when there are screenwriters and directors with good ideas and just need some money. Speaking of money, if you want to waste it; Bones is as good a film as any to waste it on. Well, if you like to waste money and you enjoy pain, that is. Bones is notable for one of the most incredible reasons a film can be notable for, and that is that it stars a rapper. The rapper in question is Snoop Dogg (a.k.a. Dogg, Snoopy, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Snoop and just about every other lame variant of the words 'snoop' and 'dogg' that you can come up with). The tired blend of Hellraiser and rubbish movie starring a rapper see Snoop Dogg get to flex his acting muscles, and he proves with his one-note performance in this movie that he is just as adept at the art of acting as he is at the art of music making. If you catch my drift.<br /><br />To be quite frank, despite his best efforts to look cool; Snoopy Doggy Dogg ends up looking like just as much of an idiot as his name suggests he is. I mean seriously, who goes by the name of 'Snoop Dogg' when they don't have to? Aside from it's star, this film has a number of other problems. It's plot is very tired, and it follows the exceedingly boring and familiar tale of someone who was killed being resurrected and then taking their revenge. The tacky dialogue, duff acting and illogical plotting don't help this, and not even the murders can save the film, as it's easy to say that even they manage to score maximum points on the dull scale. I will never forgive the people responsible for this movie for wasting all that time and money on it, when it could have been put to better use. How about giving one of the more experienced directors who could produce something good, if given a budget? I guess that's one of the many problems with things like rap music; if it sells, it will continue to be made.\n",

It jumps from one scene to the next containing irrelevant characters who really serve no purpose to the thin story line the film does have.<br /><br />The characters that do feature have no clear Character traits and little if no back story meaning that you can't relate or care what happens to them.

Yancey Arias' portrayal of Miguel Cadena is compelling and I truly believe that the character of Miguel has the potential to be one of the most memorable television characters ever created. I, particularly, like the strong female characters portrayed by Angela Alvarado Rosa and Sheryl Lee. Alvarado-Rosa's 'Delia Flores' is smart, dedicated and tough; a worthy adversary for Miguel. Marlene is equally smart, tough and determined to retain her current lifestyle. She's no Carmella Soprano.

Hunter (Tom Butler) that helped him to win the elections. Alex's fiancé Grant Coleman (Doug Savant) is a close friend of the president, after saving the life of his daughter Jessica, and he intends to propose Alex. The conspirators leaded by Hunter decide to eliminate President Hayes while in Seattle to inaugurate the cable wire transportation Skytran, and they hire the professional and seductive killer Nina Stahl (Ona Grauer) and her brother and hacker Evan Stahl (Aaron Grain). With part of the Secret Service compromised and serving to the purposes of the Vice-President, Alex faces difficulties to protect the president.<br /><br />\"First Target\" is a surprisingly solid thriller made for television that overcame my best expectations.

            "This shows has no plot line outside of a mad scientist who forces a home-made robotic chicken to watch random TV clips. It's all done in stop-motion animation and uses popular cartoon characters and toys from the late seventies and early eighties. The skits could be anything from a parody of a movie or TV show, a fake commercial, or just random events (presumably TV shows as the robot chicken is being forced to view a multitude of TV screens at the opening of every episode). The humor is often dark, dealing with subjects like psychosis, murder, terminal illness, abuse, rape, the awkwardness of adolescence, and violence in general, but the writers are not above making light of even that.<br /><br />One memorable skit involved the three possible endings to a story in which an abusive husband murders his wife as his son and the Tooth Fairy listen in from the child's bedroom, at the end of which a parade of characters comes into the boy's room with banners proclaiming and celebrating it as the darkest sketch in television history. While the humor is definitely not clean in nature, it's appealing to older adolescents and adults, particularly those who grew up with the toys and cartoons they most often utilize in the show (transformers, thundercats, rainbow bright, smurfs, scooby doo, gi joe, etc.).\n",

However I believe it had a new plot being to catch a mysterious criminal known as the Iceman. I thought it had a great twist on who was the main bad guy after all. The end shootout was one of the best in the action movie history. There were also some good comedy scenes between Murphy and Nolte. Andrew Divoff does good as Ganz brother. Murphy's scene in the bar however is bad and does not even come close to the original. In my opinion this was a good action/comedy sequel to a classic original.\n",

It reminds me altogether of \"Smoking/No Smoking\", without the narrative twist, and \"On connaît la chanson\", without the songs. I like the way Resnais creates a whole universe, half realistic, half dreamlike, with only six characters, limited sets and omnipresent snow. These six characters struggle with loneliness, butting against various obstacles : wrong match, bad luck, lack of will or perverse manipulation. The general atmosphere is kind of sad, but in a cool and soft way (snowy if I may say so), and with humorous touches, especially all that relates to videotapes and an invisible but perfectly audible grumpy old man played by Claude Rich (which makes seven characters actually). The acting is impeccable, with a special note for Sabine Azema, André Dussolier and Pierre Arditi. And an interesting cast for Lambert Wilson (playing against type).\n",

            "John Mctierman and company have laid claim to the word 'Predator'. They have created the ultimate hunter/killer roaming the universe looking for worthy prey and this time it's Arnold (Dutch), and his able military team. This movie is fast paced enough to please action fans but also skillfully creates suspense by keeping their stalker in the shadows so that the predator feels ever present and is just cautiously eyeing and selecting it's prey. Bit by bit it is revealed to us until it's full horror is unleashed in the climatic scene.<br /><br />The casting of this movie is near perfection, except for Shane Black who was offered a bit part when he was not needed for screenwriting duties. Arnold is the ultimate screen superhero. He is seemingly invincible and his overbearing confidence makes his casting as a leader natural. His muscles, thick austrian accent and powerful name have helped him permanently claim roles as his own - Conan, the Terminator and of course this one. Without Arnold in the sequel, it was always going to pale in comparison. For the screen superhero it was obligatory to have an adversary from outer space. Only in this way was Arnold going to have to use all that he had to overcome the invader. This is the match - up that moviegoers will want to see - the world's superhero trying to save us from a threat from outer space. Although this sounds reminiscent of the 40's and 50's when Hollywood capitalized on people's fears of a threat from outer space, this movie far transcends those B grade movies.<br /><br />His crack unit is composed of some of the most outlandish characters the action genre has to offer. There is Jesse Ventura, the loud and attention seeking ex - professional wrestler. His gun says it all - everything is over the top with him. Sonny Landham is the indian with a sixth sense. It is this contribution that adds to the movie's suspense - he senses the Predator and quickly comes to realize that the team is up against something stronger than them. This unnerves the others since Billy is always the calmest and is able to access the enemy and give his team the advantage. Then there is of course the seasoned screen professional, Carl Weathers. He is always in top physical condition and this along with his smoothness, is ideal for his role as the ex - ops boy who becomes a collar and tie agent - a job that requires different values and he now uses the men he used slog in the trenches with. This grouping together of such strong personalities must have created a very competitive atmosphere which would have translated into better performances. Notwithstanding this fact John Mctierman must have had a big balancing act on his hands.<br /><br />Arnold's contribution to the movie was not just that of the leading character, he also recommended Stan Winston after the first Predator creation was curtly rejected by John Mctierman. His creation embodies all one could imagine that the alien predator could have. It has missiles, spears, blades as talons, camouflage, infra - red eyesight and can deftly move within any environment. Of particular note is how the predator looks. It is the personification of our nightmares. Our fears tend to exaggerate our monsters and they are endowed with unnaturally long claws, glaring evil eyes, excessive mandibles ending with unusually long teeth and they are of immense size and strength. This is spawned by Stan in his alien predator creation. Undoubtably he is the man best able to create these monsters that haunt us at night.<br /><br />Although there are scenes that remind you of the 70's slasher flicks, it is never done for the sake of it. These scenes show us how deadly the predator is and how it can swiftly attack and disappear without trace. The fact that highly trained team members are being killed in this way makes the rest feel vulnerable to the point of cracking. Unlike these slasher films the acting is better, no - one is helpless and these scenes fit into the story and are not the excuse for it.<br /><br />The climatic encounter is fantastic. Dutch uses all his capabilities to overcome the predator, but when facing his end the predator sizes him up as an opponent worthy enough to face unarmed. It had found a prey that by facing in unarmed, pure combat, it would prove itself as the true warrior. It's drive to be the ultimate warrior is it's undoing since it affords Dutch the opportunity to lead it to a trap.<br /><br />Also worthy of mention is the powerful military soundtrack thus setting the tone for a meeting of two great forces where one will stand and one will fall.<br /><br />\n",

            "\"A man is only as faithful as his options.\" --Anonymous (or maybe Gene Simmons).<br /><br />Men, when you're dragged by your fem-boss like the vagina-whipped pussy you've become, to see GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST, at least take solace in the film's educative axioms during its first act.<br /><br />\"The power of a relationship lies with whoever cares less.\" \"It's your feelings for her that are killing your game.\" \"...marriage is an archaic and oppressive institution that should have been abolished years ago...\" Of course, these truisms are regarded as misogynistic pap within the context of this pea-brained excuse for a romantic comedy (that men will say they enjoy in order to part a woman's thighs); societal truths that women refuse to believe men believe.<br /><br />Even if one were to regard romantic \"love\" as true, this movie itself - and all its characters - hypocritically denounce everything they claim to believe in at every turn with their unthinking, irrational, contradictory actions.<br /><br />Professional Philanderer Connor Mead (Matthew McConaughey) and Jenny Perotti (Jennifer Garner) are the couple just waiting to be paired. Director Mark Waters and writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore make no bones about ripping off Dickens's A Christmas Carol as the movie's plot: a spectral playboy uncle (Michael Douglas) appears to arrogant bachelor Connor to warn him of three ghosts who will visit him to show him the \"error\" of his skirt-chasing ways.<br /><br />These apparitions appear to Connor at his brother's wedding rehearsal weekend, where Connor is busy getting drunk and going Larry David by telling it like it is: \"...love is magical comfort food for the weak and uneducated; makes you feel all warm and relevant but in the end, love leaves you weak, dependent - and fat.\" Playing Connor's brother Paul with no conviction is Breckin Meyer (so beige his name shouldn't have capital letters), who is marrying a wildly retarded woman (Lacey Chabert) who looks like Jennifer Love-Hewitt without the talent, in other words, exactly like Jennifer Love-Hewitt.<br /><br />Michael Douglas's ghost is hilarious when he's telling truths about staying powerful in relationships, but it's all for naught, as he is stuck in a Chick Flick that will ultimately emasculate him and make him confess that philandering will leave you lonely. Never once considering that marrying a shrike whom you will eventually lose interest in will also leave you lonely.<br /><br />Connor tells his brother: \"You're going to be miserable without her\" - again, never once considering that he could very well be miserable WITH her.<br /><br />If you think I'm belaboring this point, it is nothing compared to how the film pounds home its dangerously skewed idiot girlie message about absolute states, again and again. And again. And again. And again.<br /><br />Never once considering the reality that you CAN be joyful within a marriage. AND joyful without.<br /><br />Connor, who is a famous avant-garde photographer of women, is shown his girlyman dates with Jenny; his search for true love supposedly at an end and him not taking the opportunity to \"settle down.\" But if he had settled down at that point, his success would have faltered, for it was the fire in his bachelorhood that gained him the financial and critical success.<br /><br />None of this is taken into account because - Women Be Dreamkillers. It makes no difference how HIS career path might have derailed - as long as SHE be happy.<br /><br />He tells her she's gorgeous - but she's Jennifer Garner. Should those lips really go with those cheekbones - or was there a mistake at the clinic? Jenny insists Connor \"woo her,\" which he does, playing foosball and eating ice cream together and generally becoming female in order to pretend he doesn't want to bed her - until Jenny, like all women, deludes herself that he \"isn't like other guys\" and invites him to bed with a clear deluded conscience.<br /><br />Then - after all her yammering about \"taking it slow,\" she forces him to spend the night. Let me get this straight: HE has no say in the matter.<br /><br />The future fem-ghost, all sinister in flowing white robes and mute, shows Connor Jenny's wedding - to someone else.<br /><br />During this \"future wedding\" scene, Jenny looks back at the church door regretfully, as if Connor might appear to halt the proceedings. So... women get married because someone - anyone - ASKS them to, not because they really love the person. Never once is it considered what a shallow, time-serving person Jenny is for allowing a man to think she is \"in love\" with him, yet hoping - longing - to be rescued from his embrace by someone whom she believes she loves more.<br /><br />So after hammering home the idiocy that marriage will keep you from misery, the movie shows us explicitly how a marriage can BE misery (for HER as she pines for her \"True Love\"; for HIM as he never gets through to her completely), yet it never recants from its demonstrably incorrect platitude. Demonstrated incorrect by ITSELF! GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST is another in a long line of tiresome films where females prove conclusively they don't know WHAT they want. If a man has Game, he must be denigrated as an amoral, emotionless philanderer; if he doesn't have game, he is a dweeb, like Breckin Meyer or his coterie of groomsmen even more pathetic than himself.<br /><br />And the grandest irony is that, like all powerful men, Matthew McConaughey actually leads the profligate lifestyle portrayed in GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST. At certain times he may choose to settle for awhile on one favorite, at times he may be married - but - there isn't a woman in the audience who wouldn't gladly destroy any McConaughey relationship for a lick of that v-shaped man-chest and a night of that southern drawl.<br /><br />Michael Douglas was right all along...<br /><br />--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).\n",

It left a lot hanging. I wonder if the Sci-Fi channel plans to finish the show. If anyone knows then feel free to email me. Let me know when they are planning to air the rest of the show or if it is still in production. I checked a few online sites but I didn't have any luck with finding any real comment on the subject. Has anyone seen the DVD version in the stores yet? I found the VHS version a few years ago but you could only purchase two episodes at a time and considering the price I didn't think it was worth the cost. I want the entire TV series with the original cast members. I am not interested in the newer version with Barry Van Dyke as one of the major characters.\n",

            "Where do you start? How about the warped message this film is sending out to children who's families genuinely have money issues? I almost choked on my own disgust when Troy complained that he was fed up of seeing all the rich people at the Country Club while his parents were 'scraping for pennies'. With a house the size of his I doubt they're scraping for anything. Secondly, isn't it wonderfully convenient that they all managed to get pretty good jobs with no previous work experience and that they all managed to secure employment on their first attempt, at the same place, at the same time. Apart from being the luckiest group of 'teenagers' in the world, they are all the most ungrateful group of spoilt brats I've ever witnessed. The jobs they secured aren't given away to teenagers with no employment record and you don't become an assistant chef because you made a Crème Brule and some cookies then complain about it.<br /><br />Apart from those two minor points that really, really grated on me, the rest of the film is truly dire. I would happily watch High School Muscial (which, I am shamed to admit, made me laugh a little) every day for a week rather than sit through this trash again. The pointless, meandering plot-line, the dreadful, dreadful songs and the nauseating tones of Vanessa Hudgens were all too much for me. I stayed true to my word and sat through the whole thing, but not before my soul was permanently tainted. You may think I'm exaggerating, and you might be right, but a movie hasn't dragged like this since the Forty Year Old Virgin. Mercifully, I didn't have to pay for this one, but I did have to waste electricity on it.<br /><br />There are many, many bad points to be raised about this poor excuse for a film, and I think Nastarinvonjacobis has made them quite eloquently. Oh, and before I forget, who in the world has a portrait photograph of themselves in their basketball gear in their own room? A dreadful film, even by Disney Channel's standards, I don't recommend this film to anyone, unless you're playing a drinking game to take a shot every time something in this film annoys you (not recommended for those who don't want to get seriously drunk)\n",

However, I must disagree with that same person's opinions about the film.<br /><br />In short it is a very bleak and rather depressing type of comedy. The central character and her family lead a desperately empty existence, which is portrayed well by the bleak cinematography of Belgian suburbia and a dreary port town.<br /><br />There is precious little dialogue and yet plenty of Belgian-style slapstick interaction between characters. The effect of the film is not uplifting, cheery or even diverting.

It was difficult not to change the channel on this show in the first ten minutes; I cannot imagine plodding through an entire droning, silly season of this.

            "A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short.<br /><br />Worried about having enough food to feed her family come Wintertime, THE WISE LITTLE HEN decides to plant a field of corn. Her idle friends, Peter Pig & Donald Duck, decline to help with the planting or the harvesting - leaving the little chicken to plan her sweet revenge...<br /><br />This is a very fine adaptation of the childhood story, with a strong, self-reliant title character (voiced by Florence Gill). But the reason this is a landmark cartoon is because it was the debut of the irascible, anti-social, temperamental, infuriating & utterly lovable Duck, a character so strong he would soon eclipse Mickey Mouse himself. With voice courtesy of the inimitable Clarence Nash, Donald would become one of the world's most popular personalities & a source of never-ending fascination for those who study anti-social behavior and its consequences.<br /><br />Fate would not be so kind to Peter Pig. Although his debut was just as conspicuous as the Duck's, he lacked that certain intangible quality which would set him apart from the common swine. Hollywood can be a cruel place & Peter's attempts to build a movie career - he worked for a while as Porky Pig's stunt double - proved a failure. When last heard of, Peter Pig was living in a small apartment over a garage in Pomona, California.<br /><br />The SILLY SYMPHONIES, which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929, are among the most fascinating of all animated series. Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount, with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music. There was little plot in the early Symphonies, which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals, all moving frantically to the soundtrack. Gradually, however, the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot, characterization & photographic special effects. The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale, Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed. It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring. In 1939, with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon, Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES; they had run their course & served their purpose.\n",

Having nothing to do with the original, this Roger Corman release is another in a long line of films that steals scenes from \"Battle Beyond the Stars,\" some other movie I couldn't identify, and makes very little sense. Here's a rundown of what I understood:<br /><br />Various individuals from Earth awake on a spaceship, having few memories of their lives. Wandering around the ship, they come across three people who claim to not know what is going on. In reality, these beings are aliens from a dying race. They have surgically implanted something into some of the humans. Their plan is for the humans to fornicate (yup, it must be a Roger Corman movie) so that their race will continue. But, as expected, there is a mutiny among the aliens, and people being to die off. Blah, blah, blah...<br /><br />It is hard to figure out what in the world Robert Englund is doing in this movie. He can do so much better. There is nothing in this movie worthy of praise. Start your own \"star quest\" and look for a movie that actually shines just a little bit. Zanatos's score: 1 out of 10.\n",

            "Shivers starts by introducing us, the viewer that is, to Starline Tower a luxury high rise apartment complex situated on an island. The only access is a bridge connecting the island to the nearest city which happens to be Montreal. Starline Tower is almost totally self contained with it's own shops, swimming pool, golf course & even it's own medical clinic manned by Dr. Roger St. Luc (Paul Hampton) & Nurse Forsythe (Lynn Lowry). On a seemingly ordinary day like any other something terrible is happening in Starline Tower, a university professor named Dr. Emil Hobbes (Fred Doederlein) has just brutally killed a young girl whom he was both having an affair with & using as a guinea pig for his bizarre experiments & he slits his own throat shortly after. Since he knew Dr. Hobbes Dr. St. Luc decides to do a little investigating himself & talks to Hobbes partner Rollo Linski (Joe Silver) who says that they were working on breeding a parasite that can take over the function of a diseased or damaged human organ. Meanwhile back at Starline Tower a resident named Janine Tudor (Susan Petrie) is worried about her husband Nicholas (Allan Kolman) as he seems 'very ill' which he is. Nicholas begins to vomit up leech like creatures that then start to bite & infect the other residents of Starline Tower who in turn go on a violent, sexual deviant rampage as the strange disease carried by these grotesque parasites spreads rapidly through Starline Tower. Dr. St. Luc & Nurse Forsythe discover the truth but while it may already be too late for Starline Tower & it's unfortunate residents they must stop the parasites from escaping the island & into the city where they will be all but impossible to stop...<br /><br />This Canadian produced film also known as The Parasite Murders & They Came from Within, both Orgy of the Blood Parasites which would have been a fantastic name for a film & The Parasite Complex were apparently working titles, was written & directed by David Cronenberg. Shivers is considered to be his first proper film & I personally liked Shivers much more than the rest of Cronenberg's early films like The Brood (1979) & Scanners (1981) for instance. The script moves along at a nice pace & I never found it became boring unlike the Cronenberg films I've mentioned. I must also give Cronenberg credit for giving credibility & substance to a somewhat silly premise as he directs with deadly seriousness. Cronenberg throws in all sorts of everyday metaphors & messages as you would expect, the perils of sleeping around (you may get a parasite which will then possibly go on to infect the entire population of Earth!), modern scientific techniques, human isolation & the dangers of taking a bath & not noticing a large slug like creature crawling towards your privates! All of the characters are interesting & well flesh out so we actually care for them which helps the film enormously. Shivers doesn't contain much blood or gore, a few slimy parasites crawling around, the parasites themselves poking around around inside people causing their skin to bulge & a bit of blood is about as graphic as Shivers gets. Technically Shivers is a little on the rough side but this is to be expected since it was Cronenberg's first film, having said that it's not badly made but it's just not as polished as maybe you might expect from Cronenberg. Shivers was obviously a low budget film but Cronenberg managed to create a film better in style, atmosphere, substance & originality than the means & tools he had at his disposal would have suggested he could. The acting is pretty good & I suspect we have Cronenberg to thank for that, Joe Silver as Rollo Linski stands out in particular & dominates every scene he's in. Overall I enjoyed Shivers more than much of Cronenebrg's early films & I'd say definitely worth watching for both fans of Cronenberg & horror in general.\n",

Bad film that none of the actors take seriously (except Yor). Will Yor lead the people to the promise land and find out the meaning behind that funky gold medallion that he wears around his neck? Go out and Get Yor!! I wish I could see the original eight hour version shot for European television. When will this Drive-In gem ever be released on video?

            "What do Jesus Christ, a foul-mouthed 8-year-old girl with malicious powers, a flock of evil birds and the owner of the Atlanta basketball team have in common? This riddle sounds like the set-up for a lame joke, and that happens to be also the best way to describe \"The Visitor\": a lame, bad, drawn-out and overlong joke! The biggest mystery to unravel here is WHY so many terrific and experienced actors got lured into signing up to star in this cinematic mess! The cast includes John Huston, Sam Peckinpah (both prominent directors themselves), Lance Henriksen, Glenn Ford, Mel Ferrer, Franco Nero and Shelley Winters. The plot is impossible to summarize, mainly because there are too many story lines and it really doesn't make the slightest bit of sense as a wholesome. The whole thing reverts back to the ancient battle between good and evil, fought out on earth. No less than Jesus Christ is giving us insight (if you can call it that) in the situation, and then he sends out an elderly angel to Atlanta, because that's where the final earthly descendant of the evil sorcerer Zathaar lives. The visiting angel's mission (I think) is to prevent that the woman, named Barbara, bares another child and he drastically succeeds. Then he still has to bring back her other daughter, the sinister Katy, back to the heavens. And there are birds. Lots and lots of birds. \"The Visitor\" is truly bizarre, but not in a positive way. Many of the action sequences and murderous accidents are clearly inspired by \"The Omen\" and perhaps the whole concept is even derived from that classic, as well as from \"Rosemary's Baby\". That would make this film the most ambitiously complex and admirably disguised rip-off ever made, but still a failure nevertheless. There are two notably powerful sequences, one involving an awkward during the young girl's birthday party and the other being the painful death-ride of the investigating police officer. \"The Visitor\" is an unbearably pretentious film, ridiculously plotted and remarkably boring considering the overload of story elements. The screenplay often feels incomplete and very incoherent. The fantasy elements are beyond lame and the special effects wouldn't even impress a 4-year-old. The cover-image displayed here on the website looks creepy and intriguing, but sadly like in too many cases, it's utterly irrelevant. Trust the rating and user-comments in this particular case: you do not want to see this junk\n",

            "I liked this film from the moment I heard the story-line. The thing that I REALLY like about it is the fact that the production team found a way to put sci-fi elements into the story while still making it believable. The acting was good on all fronts; the African-American woman (I think her name was Shasta or something to that effect) was very natural in her conversations with Washington. Carlin's (Washington's) curiosity about the inner working of the agency he is later employed by in the beginning of the film is very believable. It is this seamlessness that makes the movie as a whole more believable. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone old enough to understand it; although it's gotten mixed reviews, I still think it's a gem among other more shallow, lackluster films.\n",

Her vulnerability and honesty are as inescapable as her demons. And you cannot help but be drawn into such a real sense of both conflict & compassion, duty and despair...this film completely melted my face off while cementing an admiration and awe I rarely experience from an actor's performance.

Maybe part of this is because I am not the biggest fan of musicals, but I think more of this has to do with how beautifully made this film is. The film was directed by the great Ernst Lubitsch--a man renowned for his deft artistic touch and romanticism in films. All this is so apparent in this film, as it is just a work of art--gorgeous and romantic through and through. The sets, camera-work and acting are all exquisite and help to make this a very memorable film. If you want to see a sound version, help yourself.

Roma Violenta is by no means a bad movie, but it does nothing any number of poliziotteschi films can't do better and it doesn't impress with what it does either.<br /><br />Maurizio Merli plays another inspector, this time Commisarrio Betti. There's a healthy number of car chases, fistfights, gundowns and just about anything you would expect from a film of this kind, but it's all done with such a workmanlike air from Marino Girolami (Castellari's father) that I couldn't help but glance at my watch every now and then. Girolami does Roma Violenta with the get-it-over-with attitude of a professional instead of the enthusiasm of a fan. Get in, take the master shot, take the close-ups, get it over with cos there's a paycheck in the end. No imagination whatsoever. I can imagine him on set crossing things off a list: \"Car chase? Check. Fistfight? Check\".<br /><br />Polizioto fans that need their fix will be satisfied by Roma Violenta, but if you haven't seen true genre classics like The Cynic, The Rat and The Fist, Almost Human or La Mala Ordina, then Roma Violenta can wait.\n",

            "These films of the 1930s, 1939 in this case, are amazing. Simple acting, yet still quite inspired by silent movies technique. Very simple setting not cluttered with too many useless props and other decorations. The dialogue is necessarily simple and the voice work is a caricature of dramatic speech. It was all recorded directly when the film was shot on a sound stage most of the time and the microphones were still very primitive. So what could you expect? No integrated music, no sound effects or very poor ones, no visual effects of course with most of the time sedentary cameras. And the lighting was still far from particularly brilliant. And yet these films were magic because they did not even try to look real, realistic. They had to work the way the technique dictated it. Then the rest was compensated and supplemented by the imagination of the audience. And the zippers in the backs of the monsters were not bothering anyone at the time since it was such a marvelous improvement to have the puppets on the screen speak in real voices. It is amazing to see such an old film by Hitchcock. He was already a great director who could get some real gripping action or situations even with all the shortcomings of his equipment. We have to watch them again these old films, these first talkies, to ,be able to appreciate what modern films have to offer but also what we have lost along the way, a lot more than we may think, and particularly the magic of black and white illusion. But we can't be and have been at once, that's obvious.

But I found it quite unforgivable that you simply can't believe in the first part of the movie the main character is a man. Filmed already in these times of CGI and make up professionals, I can't understand why the filmmakers didn't make the actress look more like a man. Or, if this was too much a hard thing to do, why they didn't choose a real man to act in the first minutes. This is too obvious and too much disturbing not to rate the movie as high as it could have been.

And I know others who are much more intelligent than me and some who I would even guess are certifiable geniuses who also loved this movie.<br /><br />This movie is captivating. As other people have written, Sneakers can be watched over and over again. Its a suspense thriller that doesn't try to blind you with so many special effects that you lose sight of the fact that less than five minutes was used to create and edit the script (ie. Mission Impossible 2).<br /><br />This is a fun movie for anybody who is a team player. Its very entertaining to see how each member of Redford's team brings an essential element to the task at hand. There are a couple of scenes where some things are far fetched, but nothing outside the rhelm of possibility. There is nothing that makes you groan in disgust, as if say you were watching any scene in a John Woo film. For a movie like this to work it has to be believable, and this is believable.<br /><br />Sneakers is original in its ideas and the characters are very likable. Even the villian possesses qualities that make you like him. Each character is developed enough so that by the end of the movie you want to be a part of the team.

            "The main virtue of \"Death on the Nile\" is Agatha Christie's unbeatable whodunit plot, which is arguably even more beautifully constructed than that of \"Murder on the Orient Express.\" The latter had been adapted for the screen in 1974 by one of America's great filmmakers, Sidney Lumet.<br /><br />Like its predecessor, \"Death on the Nile\" was filmed with a fine all-star cast, in which Peter Ustinov, Bette Davis, Angela Lansbury, Maggie Smith, Mia Farrow, David Niven and Jack Warden stand out. Ustinov's Hercule Poirot is perhaps a bit less eccentric than Albert Finney's or David Suchet's, but I actually like all three interpretations.<br /><br />The film is as lavishly produced as \"Orient Express.\" It has nice costumes and beautiful natural locations. John Guillermin isn't as strong a director as Lumet is. Consequently, the images in \"Death on the Nile\" are pretty, but less artistically interesting than those in the preceding film. Moreover, Guillermin's visual storytelling is a bit repetitive (he shows all the possible versions of the murder in detail, which tends to become a bit tedious after a while), and the first half could have been shortened a bit. Still, the direction is way above average, and Guillermin handles the action scenes and the solution in a convincing way.<br /><br />To me, \"Murder on the Orient Express\" is the most artistically satisfying Poirot film, but \"Death on the Nile\" is the most entertaining of the Poirot adaptations with Ustinov as the Belgian detective. \"Evil Under the Sun\" is also enjoyable, since its strong second half more than compensates for the overlong exposition. <br /><br />I'd give \"Death on the Nile\" a rating of *** out of ****.\n",

Helen Mirren proves she is one of the few actresses that can play tough and sexy at the same time. <br /><br />This modest budget film is quite clever. It wears the clothes of a gangster film but is actually a violent whodunit. The setting of London gives it novelty and like all British pictures it has an array of small parts played with gusto by local actors.<br /><br />The film seems to borrow from real events (at one time the Mafia did want to bring gambling junkets over to London) but is mostly a work of fiction. Also curious is that it seems to give the impression that police corruption is rife which is not true of the late 70's. But this at least helps us understand Hoskins power.<br /><br />This is not to be missed if you are a fan of gangster films and want a change of scenery. Hoskins performance alone is worth the price of admission and look out for Pierce Brosnan at the end in a non-speaking role.\n",

The immediate air support didn't turn up until later when everybody had gone home, had they flown all the way from America? You felt absolutely no sympathy with the characters, we had just about every clichéd character you could think of except the chirpy cockney and the scouse scallywag. They tried to build backgrounds and personalities to the characters but failed miserably, maybe because it was done very lazily, ie having two actors discuss all the characters for our benefit while they eat.

So last night I eventually got to watch \"Explorers\".<br /><br />The movies introduces the three main characters very well; each having their own background with their own unique capabilities. Wolfgang Müller (River Phoenix) is the intelligent creator of complex things, Ben Crandall (Ethan Hawke) is the dreamer but his intelligence is not to be underestimated and Darren Woods (Jason Presson) is a normal, but a bit lonely, kid who happened to stumble into Ben's life and sees the opportunity to 'escape' from or rather to forget his problems at home for a while.<br /><br />As the movie continues, the plot evolves very well. The switching between excitement and adventure leaves the watcher wanting for more. Up until 20 minutes or so before the end I thought the movie was 'perfect'.<br /><br />The part following in which the aliens are introduced did not contribute much. I think this is mainly because the movie ended right after that part. If the writers had wrote a better ending, giving a meaning to the whole scene of meeting the aliens, then I think the movie would have lasted for about 10-15 more minutes.<br /><br />But then again, the movie is about 3 teenagers having their dreams come true and not so much about meeting aliens.<br /><br />For me it was the first time I saw Ethan Hawke play as young as that age (15). He was fairly easy to recognize and despite his age he did a very good performance. The same goes for Jason Presson and the late River Phoenix, who was barely recognizable. His character was something totally different than he would play in future films.<br /><br />Also barely recognizable was Robert Picardo as Wak, Wak's Father and Starkiller. Knowing him mostly from his role in \"Star Trek: Voyager\" (bald) and (his voice) from \"Totall Recall\" I had difficulties actually recognizing him.<br /><br />To conclude: \"Explorers\" is a delightful, heartwarming teen/adventure film about 3 teenagers having their dreams come true. All of the 3 main actors, and all supporting actors, did a superb job. I think this movie is highly underrated and that not many people know it exists.<br /><br />I hope to see more films like this in the future. But nowadays, teen/adventure movies are either complete nonsense or Disney movies for children. Oh well, I think times just have changed... a lot.<br /><br />My score is 7 out of 10 for great acting, a good story but a bit of a let down ending.\n",

            "This movie is the younger brother to David Lynch's _Wild at Heart_. Its direction and performances are rougher and more archly surreal but I think director Araki wanted it that way. This movie does have a plot but its landscape is almost entirely psychological--especially the ending. It combines punk and pre-Goth music with a character, Jordan White, who is a kind of lovingly accepting, moment-by-moment Christ-figure. If you can accept that statement, you should watch this movie.<br /><br />By the way, the opening credit \"A heterosexual movie by Gregg Araki\" is a bit of a flipped bird to reviewers who pigeonholed his last movie with the tag \"gay film.\" \"Doom Generation\" does have a gay subtext throughout; a very interesting one, too.\n",

            "Let me begin by saying that \"the Secret of NIMH\" is my favorite movie of all time. I've often wondered why Don Bluth has never made any movie that has been anywhere near as good as this one (granted \"NIMH\" is about as perfect as any animated movie can get, so it's sort of a tough act to follow). Then I had the Golden Moment: Bluth is a Hayao Miyazaki trapped in the body of a Michael Eisner. On the one hand, he wants to elevate animation to an art form capable of heart rending beauty. On the other, he feels like he has to make films that are marketable, and that will be hits. In short, he's been clipping his own wings.<br /><br />With that in mind, watching \"Rock-a-Doodle\" made me physically ill. It is the one movie that has completely screwed up my \"is it worse that 'Theodore Rex'?\" rating system, because it is so depressing to watch. Why did Bluth greenlight this story (if you can call it that)? You can be a parody of the old Elvis musicals, you can be an adventure with some animals lost in a strange city, you can be a fantasy with an evil wizard who wants an eternal night, you can be a dumb little kids' movie with some stupid kid dancing with cartoon animals. You can be any *ONE* of these movies but you cannot be all four at once!\n",

            "This movie is beyond bad, I thought it could be a decent enough comedy with some hot latina-chicks.<br /><br />The latter there were plenty of, but the style of this movie is extremely childish so there aren't any sexiness going on, I mean just look at the rating: Rated PG for MILD sensuality.<br /><br />The story is as if taken from a Spanish-SOAP-OPERA and the acting is as over-the-top as that as well, I found SOFIA VERGARA funny in SOUL PLANE and ROSELYN SANCHEZ is good in WITHOUT A TRACE but they were as bad as the rest of the bunch in this \"comedy\".<br /><br />Comedy: Yes, but where are the jokes? Were there any? And did this movie even make me chuckle even once? No.<br /><br />Not even cameo's from talents DL HUGHLEY (Stand-Up-Comedian) and FREDDY RODRIGUEZ (Harsh Times) could make me enjoy this movie, it just made me think how on earth they got into this horrible movie.<br /><br />One thing that's even more confusing is the fact that FOREST WHITAKER is listed as a producer, to me he's one of Hollywood's finest and hopefully his producer-spot just meant that he financed the movie and wasn't actually a part of making this movie because that would have been a shame.<br /><br />I'm bagging on a lot of people here, but the biggest bag should be on the lead guy Thomas (played by Eduardo Verástegui) whom delivers some of the worst acting I have ever seen in recent years, he is beyond bad in a way I can't even describe.<br /><br />There's one good thing about it though, without the start and end-credits the movie is only about 70 minutes long.<br /><br />If you want a romantic-comedy with latino-actors there is always SUENO (John Leguizamo, Elisabeth Pena) which I quite like.\n",

            "Having lived with only a handful of other tenants in a large building undergoing renovation in New York City (and on the same floor that Stephanie lived on), the subject matter of this film was a little too close to home. We also had ex-cons working in our building, and we had break-ins and crimes committed by maintenance staff, though no rapes or murders.<br /><br />The film had a couple of mildly terrifying moments, but most of it failed to convey a sense of dread, or was original enough in its details (except for the setting, which was terrific) to be considered truly frightening.<br /><br />The crimes committed were a bit too abrupt. As a previous reviewer noted, there was precious little exposition that would have lent a sense of suspense and depth. And with all the good (great) unemployed actors out there, it seems a better cast could have been picked. The film had a kind of amateurish/film-school project aura about it that was at once admirable and disconcerting.<br /><br />***** SPOILER *****<br /><br />Finally, what happened to the door leading to the outside? It seemed to have disappeared! Even if the writer/director had made the choice for Paul to chain lock the exits to the street or something, it would have lent a note of believability to the final scenes. But the victims seemed content to stay inside to play a deadly game of cat and mouse with Paul, and that made it hard for me to suspend my disbelief.<br /><br />***** END SPOILER *****<br /><br />I would like to see this film rewritten, shot with higher production values, and re-released. It has a decent kernel of a plot and a superb setting -- it just needs more vibrant characterizations, some connection to the outside world to keep it from drifting too far into the realm of disbelief, and more skilled actors. Music could have been more prominent and original, too.\n",

            "I've been a fan of the novel for quite a long time, in fact one of the publishing agents came to give a lecture when I was in college on the nature of getting your work published and kept citing the due to be released novel as an example and even then the premise he described sounded amazing. I finally got around to reading it when it went into paperback and it's a book I have recommended countless times to people of all ages and interests. It's a great example of not just a unique and beautiful story but a clever way of telling it. <br /><br />The movie on the other hand, can only be described as a disappointing mess. First of all, it immediately removes the mystery of Henry's first meeting with Claire at the Library, when he is 28 and she is 20. Why? Because it was just literally yelled at us that Henry is a time traveler. Granted, that's the name of the movie, but it just made the whole encounter feel stale. <br /><br />Which is sort of the problem of the movie in general. It presents many of the events of the novel, though many are left out as well, but it does so in a very bland \"well here's what happened\" sort of way. None of the humor or passion of the characters in the book is there, we never really get the feeling as to why Henry or Claire love each other, it all feels sort of cold, as if the characters had decided \"well this is inevitable apparently.\" <br /><br />One major thing missing though is how much of a hassle Henry's time traveling is for his own life and everyone else's around him. There's only one moment where he leaves for a long period of time, and otherwise it is just a nuisance for him and Claire. Gone entirely is his ex-girlfriend Ingrid, gone is the eerie recognition everyone around Claire has for Henry since he resembles the man she was occasionally seen with years earlier. Also gone is the fact that Henry witnesses his own death and also speaks with Claire's father and brother at the time, and Claire having arrived shortly afterwards having just missed the death too (actually to be honest, the way his death happens in the movie feels entirely avoidable). Oddly, though he is mentioned, Claire's brother is not even in the movie or at least has no dialogue. <br /><br />A few things that are major events in the book are treated as non-events in the movie, for example, the fact that Henry's first time travel was out of the car when his mother died is the very first thing revealed in the movie, when it is something of a breakthrough mental moment for Henry in the book. His relationship with his father and his father's alcoholism suffers similarly, it's mentioned but not dwelled on and ultimately is swept aside. <br /><br />OK, I don't want this review to just be \"Here's what they left out from the book!\" I understand that in order to make a movie out of a book you have to take stuff away. My point is more that things seemed cut simply for time sake and not narrative, and as such what ended up happening is that the soul, the essence of the book was removed with it. <br /><br />On another note, the movie does a terrible job of tracking when things happen and how old the characters are. This wouldn't be so bad except that there's really not a lot of quality makeup work here so there's not a lot to distinguish the way Henry looks for almost 20 years of his life. A touch of gray hair and a need to shave does not make someone look significantly older, regardless of whether he or another character says \"you/I look older!\" The movie could have used some of that Benjamin Button magic, and perhaps even some titles saying the year and that \"Henry is 28, Claire is 20\" like in the book.\n",

            "I thought this might be one of those films that would be \"good for me\" to see. I was mildly intrigued by descriptions of the story I had read and with the trailer, so I thought to take a chance. I took someone very close to me, an actual violin prodigy. Coincidently, her and I have recently been searching for a decent violin for her that is affordable by actual humans, so we could relate to parts of the plot first-hand. We arrived to a very thin theater in one of those mega-complex theaters, and while everyone was queuing up next-door to see the latest blockbuster from Hollywood I settled into an amazingly comfortable seat with an excellent view and prepared for whatever might come.<br /><br />I was shocked. This film turned out to be clearly one of the best movie going experiences I have had in ages. We see this as the story unfolds and is creatively told through the reading of the violin makers wife's fortune with a deck of Tarot cards. It is the story of a part of the life of a violin; of the humans who would dare to possess her beauty. A masterpiece of a craftsman's art, it is desired by many for it's acoustic perfection. But, as Tolstoy said, \"how complete is the delusion that beauty is goodness.\" Or more interestingly, from Saint Augustine: \"Beauty is indeed a good gift of God; but that the good may not think it a great good, God dispenses it even to the wicked.\" There seems to be a curse on this instrument as it brings ill to those who manage to possess it. This makes the ending especially eerie.<br /><br />An original, imaginative and thought provoking story that engaged one's mind as American films almost never do. I will not describe more of the plot, it's far too good to ruin. The memory of this film will be one long treasured.<br /><br />Oh, as for my guest, the honest-to-God prodigy: she said the music was magnificent (it was) even though a real musician could tell the actors weren't playing, it was well done.\n",

            "This is a movie that amused me the first time around, delighted me on further viewings, and continues to grow in my esteem. The script's light tone hides depths that surprise. Stillman strikes just the right note in a story that touches on pains and fears that are genuinely daunting (divorce of parents, love unrequited, etc) as well as the comic value of his characters' earnestness and foibles, keeping just the right distance so that comedy keeps just ahead; all leading to the modest but charming triumph of the shy and virtuous protagonists. <br /><br />The link to Mansfield Park (the book, not the movie) has been noted by some observers, with a story centered on the mischief some young people get up to while their parents are absent, and the trials this brings for the young protagonists. But this isn't Austen's story, not really. Stillman has done something like what Austen might have wanted to do, had she been a filmmaker in our time. But with his own story, his own times and mores, his own world, his own delightful touch. Considering the budget Stillman had to work with, this is a masterpiece.\n",

            "I loved Westworld, so I was excited to find out Futureworld was being aired on a local UPN station. I'd read reviews that Futureworld was disappointing, but sometimes futuristic '70s movies are a blast to watch regardless of their flaws. :-) Well, Futureworld was a real stinkeroo. I actually had fun laughing at many parts that weren't meant to be funny. I could go on for days about the ridiculous plot holes and unanswered questions, but here are just a few of my favorites: <br /><br />Why did they lead us to believe that Clark, the faceless robot \"friend\" of Harry the mechanic, *could be* The Gunslinger? Clark seemed pretty harmless, but I was waiting for an exciting moment at the end of the movie when he revealed his true, merciless character (The Gunslinger)! Instead, Clark was more of a paperweight in his scenes.<br /><br />What the heck is with the dream sequence between The Gunslinger (Yul Brynner) and Blythe Danner's character? That was so ridiculously bad that I had to turn away during parts of it. I understand it was a dream and dreams can be really weird, but that doesn't mean filmmakers have to put all our bizarre dreams on film! Before I saw the dream sequence, I was hoping so much that Brynner's cameo would add something to the movie. Instead, I was embarrassed for him. They could have cut the entire dream sequence and it never would have affected the film.<br /><br />Fonda's and Danner's characters started punching buttons on the white chamber and suddenly three ninjas materialize out of nothing! First of all, that occurred before we knew the Delos scientists were engineering human clones of the world leaders. So when I saw the ninjas magically appear fully clothed and with weapons, I was thinking, \"Since when do mechanical robots and their trappings materialize from nothing?\" Then, when we find out that these new insidious creations are flesh-and-blood, that still left me thinking, \"How on earth would you create a human clone from thin air?\" <br /><br />Why did Fonda's and Danner's characters agree to run to Westworld to hide? Did they think they could start a new life in the abandoned Westworld? We learned in the first movie that Westworld was surrounded by the Mojave desert, so there wasn't an escape route in that world. If they hoped to escape Delos, Westworld was certainly not the way out.<br /><br />Oh yes, if Delos spent millions fixing up and expanding all the worlds, even adding more worlds, why did they leave Westworld untouched? That would still be a world that people would want to enjoy, and the tragedies at Delos weren't any worse at Westworld than they were at the other worlds (in the original film). It seemed to be a strange oversight in the film.<br /><br />The big finale. I have to say I was a bit disappointed that the movie ended with Peter Fonda flipping off the evil and conniving Dr. Schneider, with Dr. Schneider responding with a melodramatic slamming of his hands on the railing of the platform he was standing on. Maybe it would be have been good for a laugh if Schneider had held his fists in the air and yelled, \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\" a la Darth Vader at the end of Episode 3. ;-) <br /><br />I do want to note that the computer-generated 3-D faces and hands were pretty advanced for 1976. I also enjoyed the '70s decor and architecture -- one of my favorite parts of '70s TV shows and movies. :-)\n",

            "Grim Reaper starts as an exotic dancer Rachel Wilson (Chersih Lee) waits for a taxi to take her home, unfortunately said taxi runs her over instead. For no apparent reason although it's hard to feel sorry for Rachel since she was standing right in the middle of the road. Rachel survives & is taken to a nearby hospital where she meets a creepy nurse (Alice Ensor) & before she knows it Rachel wakes up inside a room inside the abandoned St. Joseph's mental institution where Dr. Brown (Brent Fidler) has collected several teenagers all of whom have had near death experiences. Insdie St. Joseph's the teens start to be stalked & killed one-by-one by a hooded figure that could very well be the Grim Reaper himself as he search for those who escaped him the first time round...<br /><br />Produced & directed by Michael Feifer one has to say that Grim Reaper is awful in every just about every way & it takes a horror film buff with high tolerance levels to sit through all of it's eighty odd minutes, as for those who aren't particularly interested in the genre you probably wouldn't last much more than twenty odd minutes. The script by Ellis Walker is a total mess from start to finish, there are flashbacks, flash-forwards, dreams, dreams within dreams, hallucinations, a confusing plot that doesn't work, a terrible ending that makes no sense & the whole film is just a narrative nightmare as you are thrust from one scenario to another in the blink of an eye & thus not really giving you the chance to take the already confused plot in since it chops & changes so much. The whole point of a film in my opinion is to entertain, if a film entertains me for it's duration & I have fun then I can forgive almost anything but when it comes to a film such as Grim Reaper which is such a chore to watch I find myself rapidly losing the will to live. Considering that Grim Reaper only lasts for a relatively modest eighty odd minutes & it feels like it goes on for literally hours one could quite easily come to the conclusion it's a really boring slow moving film. The plot revolving around several teens escaping death feels right out of Final Destination (2000) only there's no clever death's & it pretty much turns into a really awful teen slasher as the Grim Reaper becomes your average Freddy Kruger type killer. The ending is awful too, since when does dying for a few minutes enable you to travel back in time & change past events? A real mess from start to finish.<br /><br />Director Feifer does OK & to be fair to Grim Reaper it's fairly well made, I am not sure why there are no lights in St. Joseph's since it appears to be the darkest mental institution on Earth but as a whole the film is reasonably well made & photographed. Unfortunately reasonable production values still don't save it from being conceptually awful & a complete total utter mess. The gore levels are disappointing, a couple of people are stabbed by the Grim Reaper while someone has pencils stuck in their face & someone is sliced in half in an unconvincing totally bloodless CGI computer effect. You will notice a lot of comments for Grim Reaper saying Rachel is a stripper but she never takes her clothes off & is more of an exotic dancer.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 Grim Reaper was a reasonably well funded film & it show's with it's decent production values although as I have already said the film is terrible so that doesn't really matter. The acting is probably below average but not the worst I have seen.<br /><br />Grim Reaper is a really awful film thanks to a terrible script that is confusing, has a rubbish story & is as dull as dishwater. Definitely one to avoid if you can help it. Not to be confused with the Joe D'Amato Italian gore film Anthropophagus (1980) which was widely released in the US & UK under the title The Grim Reaper.\n",

            "Without doubt one of the most beautiful and painful films I have ever seen. For some time into the film I didn't understand why the director decided to keep so much distance to the main characters. And then suddenly it dawned on me: These are people caught up in a much larger historical picture  out of their control  and the total historical painting is more important than all the separate details together. However, in the second half of the movie, Angelopoulos moves closer on the main characters, and the movie takes a much firmer emotional grip of your heart. This is a movie about extreme human pain in troubled times  brought on us by human pride and stupidity  and it takes some time and effort to get through this epic. But if you hang in there, it's an experience I think many of us will never forget. The final sequence is justwell, what can I say?\n",

            "Beneath Still Waters starts in 'Northern Spain 1965' as two young boys Teo & Luis trespass in a town that is being flooded by the creation of a dam, they run wild throughout it's streets but hear screaming coming from the local Church, upon investigation they find several people in the basement chained up including the evil dabbler in black magic Mordecai Salas (Patrick Gordon) whom Teo unwisely sets free as Teo is killed by Salas but Luis runs off... Jump forward '40 Years Later' & photojournalist Dan Quarry (Michael McKell) wants to do a story on the now completely submerged town & the upcoming celebrations by the town that was built nearby in place of it, however the preparations for the celebrations aren't going too well as a boy named Antonio drowns in the lake created by the dam. There is something alive & evil under the water still living in the submerged town & it's come back to claim the living...<br /><br />This Spanish production was produced & directed by Brian Yuzna who was once a great maker of genre films but he has definitely lost his touch with his last two Spanish films, this & the equally disappointing Rottweiler (2004). The script by Mike Hostench & Angel Sala was based on a novel by Matthew Costello & one has to say it's a bit of a mess which is a shame because the basic story of a ghostly underwater town is something different & had lots of potential but sadly this is what we ended up with. The character's are dull & clichéd, a journalist, a bratty teenage kid, a TV news reporter, the guy who knows everything & tries to warn everyone but no one will believe him, the police captain with a bad attitude, the local mayor who doesn't care about an impending disaster but only about his towns celebrations & a dull villain who gets to walk around in a black suit & look menacing yet without actually doing much. The things which happen almost seem at random, zombies start to pop up everywhere but there's no real explanation of how or why & then there's this black slimy stuff which is mentioned on a couple of occasions but no more & then there's the villains lame motives, as far as I could gather all he wanted was to take the new town as his own which hardly gets the pulse racing. The story goes nowhere, it's all a bit slow, a bit fragmented & it felt like a collection of ideas that were haphazardly thrown into one script without much regard for narrative or continuity. One more thing, what was up with the dude who had the slug crawling down his forehead & a goldfish bowl full of maggots?<br /><br />Dirctor Yuzna is losing it, Beneath Still Waters feels like a dour made-for-TV film at times with dull cinematography & bland Spanish locations. Then there's the annoying accents, I'm sorry but it's difficult to understand what some of these people are saying. The CGI computer effects are poor, the miniature model shots are poor although the special make-up effects fare much better. There's some decent gore here, there's some really cool looking rotting zombies, there are decapitated heads & severed limbs, the main villain like to rip peoples heads in half, someone chest bursts open, someone saws their own legs & hand off & there are also various other minor bits of blood & gore throughout although the murder of Luis seemed cut as there are noticeable jumps in the audio & too many 'reaction' shots of Teresa & Dan even though seemingly nothing has happened.<br /><br />Technically the film is alright but nothing special, it looks OK but doesn't really have any style or atmosphere & it's definitely not scary. The acting isn't great.<br /><br />Beneath Still Waters is a pretty poor film, it had potential & an original & intriguing premise but it makes nothing of it. Another disappointment from Yuzna & is it any surprise or coincidence he hasn't directed a film since this & Rottweiler?\n",

I only hope you or your loved ones did not make the mistake of watching this movie alone -- it could easily be suicide. However, if you and your friends have a sadistic passion for seeing horrible movies, this should be at the top of your to do list. My favorite scenes include stock footage of a plane taking off (when in fact the plane should be landing), using a caged bird as a projectile, throwing a woman by her breast, and don't even get me started on the ending... Just amazingly awful. Plus, did I mention there are no mechanics or \"satanics\" in this whole film? Hahaha.\n",

In 2018, after an unsuccessful attack to a Skynet facility, only John Connor (Christian Bale) survives, but he discovers that Skynet is developing the powerful new model T-800. Out of the blue, Marcus appears naked and with amnesia in the location. Marcus befriends the teenager Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and the girl Star (Jadagrace Berry) that help him to survive to lethal machines and they travel together in a Jeep. Meanwhile the resistance discovers a signal that might turn-off the machines and John offers to test it. When Kyle is captured by a machine and brought to the Skynet headquarter, Marcus decides to help the youngster and heads to Skynet; on the way, he saves Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood) that suggests him to meet John Connor first. But Marcus steps on a mine and is submitted to a surgery, when a secret about his origins is disclosed. <br /><br />\"Terminator Salvation\" is another great movie of this franchise. The story is full of action, and supported by a good story, great acting and excellent special effects. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"O Exterminador do Futuro  A Salvação\" (\"The Terminator from the Future  The Salvation\")\n",

            "Wow, did I feel torn about this film! On one hand, the film had some exceptional characters (in particular the aunt). But, on the other, the play was so inappropriate and sick in how it dealt with teen sexuality it really made me angry. If you look at this film from a completely amoral standpoint, it is a very good film with a lot to recommend it. As a parent and teacher, I was just horrified at times as I watched.<br /><br />First, what I liked. Aunt Stefania was a great character. At the beginning of the film, she was extremely rigid and controlling and so naturally her relationship with her boyfriend, Andrea, was falling apart. This opening sequence was extremely funny as they contrasted how both viewed the health of their relationship. He was miserable and yet all the terrible things she did, she saw them as the strengths of their relationship! Later, towards the end, there was a cute little twist that brought them back together. Throughout the film, some very good (but morally suspect) writing really kept my interest. Plus, having the beautiful backdrop of the Greek Isles made this film exciting to watch.<br /><br />Now as for the bad. Stefania's niece, Megghy, was a horrible mess of a character. Although she was not quite 15, her sole ambition in life was to love her virginity with ANYONE and lose it quickly! In addition, she was a habitual liar and a self-absorbed little jerk. Now had she faced any consequences for this, it could have been funny or interesting--but this never happened.<br /><br />What bothered me in particular is that Stefania is supposed to be an adult. Megghy lies to the aunt about a girl scout trip in order to go to the Greek Isles to get laid. When this supposedly responsible aunt discovers the ruse as well as why Megghy wants to go, she basically allows Megghy to run amok through the very horny island trying to find a willing partner and drink herself into oblivion! While Megghy looked older than her chronological age, her judgment was completely unsound and she was a child--and she was a likely candidate to get raped or get an STD or become pregnant (even if she went with her aunt to pick up boxes of condoms). This was supposed to be cute and funny--but to me it just seemed sleazy and morally bankrupt. Had Megghy been an adult, then perhaps you might have felt uncomfortable about her dippy behavior but you'd agree that as an adult she's free to mess up her own life. But to have the aunt help facilitate? This is just sick. Had Megghy wanted to become an assassin or sexually abuse farm animals, would Aunt Stefania have said 'no'? This film desperately needed some adults who were willing to behave as adults.<br /><br />Excellent but depraved writing--I worry what messages this film might be sending to young and impressionable kids.\n",

            "This is a low-grade horror film which has been culted into a reputation beyond its worth because of its director's involvement. The plot is strikingly similar to that of another notorious potboiler - SHE-WOLF OF London (1946) - but, at least, here the monster is seen (albeit ineffectively made-up): despite the titular reference, the script pays little to no credit to previous cinematic incarnations of the R.L. Stevenson novella - opting, instead, to indiscriminately incorporate elements of lycanthropy and vampirism which make no sense at all...but which lend the film value as a unique curio and one which, in view of its sheer audacity, it is difficult to hate (indeed, the whole misguided enterprise reminded me of the contemporaneous FRANKENSTEIN 1970 [1958])! <br /><br />Despite the ultra-cheap production, the film makes the most of its foggy atmosphere and the hallucination sequences are effective in a naïve sort of way. Casting is below-par but, at least, Arthur Shields (who also appears in a silly book-end in full monster make-up - but, then, as Gloria Talbott's legal guardian spends the rest of the film trying to convince her that she is the werewolf!!) and John Dierkes (as a particularly vehement believer in the Jekyll 'legend' despite being in their employ - or, so it seems, since he's always hovering about the estate!) enter gleefully into the spirit of the thing.<br /><br />I had been toying with the idea of purchasing the All Day DVD of this one ever since it was released; I'm glad I managed to catch up with it eventually without having to purchase the disc - being shown on late-night Italian TV, as part of a Jekyll & Hyde marathon which included snippets from a variety of films based on the venerable tale (I was especially gratified by the inclusion of a couple of scenes from Jean Renoir's THE TESTAMENT OF DR. CORDELIER [1959], which I've been yearning to see forever, and also ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET DR. JEKYLL & MR. HYDE [1953], which I haven't watched in ages - I really ought to get down to purchasing either the R1 or R2 DVD releases of the films featuring the comic duo!)...\n",

            "The film has a good premise, a Romanian prisoner, sent on revenge mission, who can transform from human to beast and back again. <br /><br />Yes, the survival film in a confined space has been done before. But what's different is that you're never really sure when the beast is going to be monster and when it's going to be human. <br /><br />The cast is pretty good, particularly Marat Glazer and AJ Hammond. Jennifer Wiggins runs a bit hot and cold (it feels like she got more direction in some scenes and less in others), but it's great to see a female action lead who can throw a punch and not look ridiculous. <br /><br />The Beast design was well conceived. The Shapeshifter has this strange ancient quality to him. The horns, the four fingered hands, the nasty teeth - it's particularly effective when he gets good and bloodied up.<br /><br />The sound mix sounded great on our system. The music is good, although it gets a bit monotonous at times and at other times seems oddly absent.<br /><br />There's quite a bit of gore, although certainly not nearly as much as Dead Men Walking, another Asylum film which was clearly shot at the same location as Shapeshifter.<br /><br />Typical of film in this budget range, there are some parts that work and some that don't. Still, the good outweighs the bad and the whole thing adds up to a fun low budget thriller.\n",

How they made such a gruesome movie out of an Agatha Christie novel is an art in itself.<br /><br />As not having read the novel, I'm not sure if the plotting mistakes are due to the writing or the adaption, but either way, they are there and aren't going away. The poison in the pills that the major never takes? Why would he take one now? The killer not trying to hush the possible poisoning but even informing the police about it? The exhumation based on the fact that a pill bottle was in his bathroom that wasn't there before? The hotel nurse telling someone in a highly suspecting way that she saw the killer? Why not tell the police or even her 'new friend' miss Marple? Dramatic effects like the exhumation during the night, some tiny voodoo and the nervy score cannot save the lack of drama.<br /><br />Badly scripted, awfully acted and Barbados seems a perpetually overcast island with some techno-echo-crickets chirping away every time we are supposed to witness outdoor scenes at night.

            "es, I've seen hundreds of WWII/Holocaust films. No other has the emotional impact as well as the realism of War and Remembrance. Of course it is the longest such film ever made at over 30 hours, which gives director Dan Curtis the time to portray everything of Herman Wouk's book. Made as a sequel to the miniseries Winds of War, this is superior in many ways. The first half on this DVD set covers the years 1941-1943, beginning with Pearl Harbor and weaving the Henry family into all the events of the war. Jane Seymour is excellent as Natalie and John Gielgud perfect as Aaron as they play cat and mouse as American Jews stuck in Europe while Aaron's \"good friend\" Beck keeps tracking them.<br /><br />With a cast of thousands, an exhaustive list of stars, and on location in ten countries, a lesser director could never have pulled it off, and Dan Curtis rises to the occasion of recreating the events to a tee, including graphic depictions of the Holocaust. A few different story lines run through. Most interesting to me is that of Natalie and Aaron and their attempts to escape Europe. Gielgud and Seymour cannot be praised highly enough for believability and complexity, their plight being the most emotion provoking. Milton Johns gives a chillingly intense portrayal of Eichmann. The next of interest is Slote (David Dukes) as a U.S. official in Europe trying to bring the Holocaust to the attention of Roosevelt, but to no avail. Pug (Robert Mitchum reprising his Winds of War role) has an interesting segment in Russia, but the Pacific War, submarine battles and all, though well done, didn't hold my interest.<br /><br />Prisoners at Auschwitz attempt to smuggle out film to the Allies, and the depiction of Holocaust events is realistic beyond belief. Volume 1 contains the Baba Yar massacre, Himmler observing a \"Special Action\", and the digging up of mass graves. Volume 2 is even more graphic. Steven Berkoff as Hitler is great with his over-the-top ranting and raging...hey you can't BE too over-the-top in portraying Hitler. Volume 1 ends after living in relative luxury with Aaron and Natalie being transported to Theriesenstadt. On the way a lady says, \"We bought an apartment there with a view by the lake\". Needless to say there was no lake.<br /><br />War and Remembrance towers over Schindler's List in every way. Up to the present W&R is the most realistic dramatic portrayal of the events. Some have learned the lessons of WWII and the Holocaust. Those currently running the world have not.\n",

Thank god Schipper didn't use any St.Pauli-cliches to make this movie even more \"Hamburgish\". I especially like the mixture of melancholy and a certain \"live your life\"-attitude. Absolute Giganten is the story of a night that is so ordinary and because of that so honestly that you're going to enjoy every minute of it. The three main characters are doing a great job especially Florian Lukas as Ricco. The table soccer scene is awesome shot. But my favorite scene is the one at this Elvis' stunt show place when Ricco shouts \"Da geht einiges!\". You need more good reasons to watch Absolute Giganten?

            "It is my heartfelt belief that no clearly thinking individual who considers him- or herself to be a student of either WWII aviation history or modern cinematography could possibly find this to be a good (or even decent) movie, from ANY standpoint. The lost potential in this film is monumental - between gathering the hardware which provides an authentic backdrop (aircraft, uniforms & flight gear, restoring a former WWII base for filming, etc.) and selecting a capable cast, the entire effort was shot in the head when it came time for the script - not to mention some model sequences which, in spite of emerging technology, still just flat don't 'work.' The juvenile behavior of the crew, particularly IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MISSION, was abominable. For me, the only shining moment was the exchange between John Lithgow and David Strathairn over the letters from home, voiced over with the gun camera footage. Beyond that, the overall film was deplorable. And after that much expenditure of effort to be wasted, I wouldn't look for any other producer to undertake a similar theme. Spielberg tackled the infantry (\"Saving Private Ryan\"), Eastwood has done justice to the Marine Corps (\"Flags of our Fathers\") - but you'll have to contend with THIS monstrosity for an 8th Air Force tribute.<br /><br />Want the real story of the 8th Air Force?

            "Move over, Harrison Ford; your namesake John got here first. While comparisons with Andrew Davis' action-packed 1993 thriller are inevitable in discussing 'The Fugitive (1947),' the two films  aside from the similarity described in their shared title  are completely unrelated, and about as different as two films could possibly be. Unlike many of the Westerns that brought director John Ford his greatest fame, 'The Fugitive' is entirely unconcerned with any form of action or dialogue; Ford's film-making is so concentrated on establishing the correct emotional atmosphere for each scene that it occasionally strays into tedium. However, it was obviously a very personal project for the Ford  who once called it \"perfect\"  and it's difficult to criticise a film into which the director poured so much passion and resolve. The story was adapted from Graham Greene's 1940 novel, \"The Power and the Glory\" {a.k.a. \"The Labyrinthine Ways\"} and concerns the plight of a victimised Christian priest, in an unnamed Latin American country where religion has been outlawed.<br /><br />Perhaps the film's greatest weakness, from my reasoning at least, is that it is so concerned with painting each character as an icon or ideal (few characters are afforded names, and are instead credited with indefinite articles; \"a fugitive,\" \"a lieutenant of police,\" \"an Indian woman\") that it's hard to sympathise with them. Fortunately, while consistently attempting to maintain each character as a \"timeless\" figure in the film's ageless story, Dudley Nichols's screenplay avoids the usual stereotypes to which most amateur filmmakers would inevitably resort. The Fugitive (Henry Fonda) is not a courageous, humble pillar of human decency, but a misguided clergy driven by an unconscious self-pride; his adversary, the Lieutenant of Police (Pedro Armendáriz), loves his country and its people deeply, but, guided by a fierce blind patriotism and an illogical hatred of religion, he is often misled towards acts of sheer barbarity. The Police Informer (J. Carrol Naish) is a Judas-like character, betraying The Fugitive to the authorities, and becoming inescapably repentant at the thought of his inhumanity.<br /><br />Despite not being particularly religious myself, I was sufficiently moved by Christianity's noble plight for survival, though I wasn't overly fond of the film's ultimate assertion that the lieutenant's hatred of religion stems directly from his secretly believing in God but being unwilling to admit it. Nevertheless, if you're going to watch 'The Fugitive,' it will most certainly be for the photography, which is, captured by Mexican cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa, indescribably breathtaking. The opening sequence, in which The Fugitive returns to his former church, the light streaking through the windows as though God himself is reaching into the forsaken depths of the building, is spellbinding in its beauty. While Armendáriz is charismatic, and even slightly sympathetic, in his role of the antagonist, Henry Fonda largely looks awkward in the lead role (though you could argue that this uneasiness is integral to his character), and most of the other players  perhaps due to a language barrier  are similarly stilted. A visual masterpiece this film may be, and certainly an overall interesting watch, but 'The Fugitive' remains inferior Ford.\n",

The whole family from the father and mother and all children are totally dysfunctional. Every new character is the same. The one who they took in their home because his father was a marine (Martin) came closest, but was also a disappointment in the end. It makes a farce of any religion I know of, but still I find myself watching and hoping. All of the children falling in love with every member of the opposite sex they meet is ridiculous.

            "Anybody who thought the original \"Deathstalker\" (1983) was abysmal should skip its lightweight, lackluster sequel \"Deathstalker: Duel of the Titans\" with John Terlesky taking over the sword wielding duties from Rick Hill as the eponymous warrior hero. Indeed, \"Deathstalker 2\" looks like a threadbare straight-to-video sequel. This potboiler relies, much to \"Big Bad Mama\" director Jim Wynorski's chagrin, on footage from its superior predecessor as well as generic Roger Corman footage. Furthermore, neither scenarist Neil Ruttenberg nor dialogue writer R.J. Robertson makes any mention of Deathstalker's previous heroic exploits. <br /><br />Wynorski states on the commentary track that they tore up the first screenplay and reworked it because it was so terrible. \"Deathstalker 2\" is pretty terrible as it is, so one can only imagine how egregious the preliminary script must have been. This cardboard muscle man adventure springs no surprises on its audience, except for the automobile tire that appears in the garbage dump where Wynorski staged a scene and candidly admits that he missed during lensing. The sword fights lack energy, and the amateurish acting, particularly by Monique Gabrielle, is laughable. <br /><br />The first scene has our hero acting like Indiana Jones as he sneaks into a castle (the shot is lifted from Corman's own movie \"The Terror,\" to steal a gem but then has to fight his way out. Since film boasts only the most minimal of budgets, lensed as it was on location in Argentina to lower costs, \"Deathstalker 2\" resembles a studio bound television comedy drama with our hero and heroine bickering with each other as they defend themselves from the adversaries. Like the original \"Deathstalker,\" \"Deathstalker 2\" pits our hero against an evil sorcerer, Jarek the Sorcerer (John Lazar of \"Scorpion\") who has magical powers. He has made a double of Princess Evie (Monique Gabrielle), cast Evie out to roam the kingdom, installed the double on the throne, and rules the kingdom. Reena, ostensibly calling herself a seer, recruits the 'prince of thieves, Deathstalker (John Terlesky of \"Vampirella\") to help her recover her throne. Meanwhile, an evil female warrior Sultana (Toni Naples of \"Munchie\") is looking to kill Deathstalker, too. <br /><br />Predictably, it's no picnic trying to slay Deathstalker as the nefarious Gen (Marcos Woinsky) learns. During one of the film's more spectacular moments, our hero and heroine ride a gauntlet of explosive arrows as Gen and his A-Team of miscreants try to kill him. The scene in the crypt where Deathstalker escapes a crushing wall and saves Evie from a crowd of zombies is about as good as this cheesy epic gets. The only other scene that matches this occurs when Jarek kills a henchman during a conversation using water fountains to communicate. Jarek shoves his sword into the fountain and kills his incompetent henchman on the other side. Later, a tribe of Amazon warrior women capture Deathstalker and force him to defend his honor in a trial by combat. The Amazons hate Deathstalker's reputation as a womanizer, and they square him off against a gigantic redhead who makes life miserable momentarily for Deathstalker.<br /><br />Like the original \"Deathstalker,\" the saving grace of \"Deathstalker 2\" is its self-effacing sense of humor. Unfortunately, there is not quite enough self-effacing humor to counteract the amateurish acting, formulaic script, and comic book bubble dialogue. The outtakes during the end credits are a bonus for anybody that hangs around long enough to enjoy them. Terlesky is more athletic than muscular. The horrendous hokum pays tribute to \"Rocky,\" \"Star Wars,\" \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" \"Escape from New York,\" and \"Goldfinger.\" Once is more than enough to see this forgettable fodder.\n",

Who can possibly fail to laugh at Marv getting the shock of his life when he tries to turn on the taps? If the movie were to be released now I doubt if it would be let away with a PG rating. Still, it's nothing for any parents to worry about. Unless you fear your child is going to set your head on fire with a blowtorch.<br /><br />Home Alone 2 has a more satisfying climax than the first. The film doesn't simply end once Harry and Marv are back in the slammer as there is more plot to it than that. Brenda Fricker has a (rather questionable) role as 'The Pigeon Lady' a woman who lives in Central Park and talks to anyone-until Kevin reaches out. Plus Eddie Bracken shows up as Mr. Duncan and gives Kevin the best Xmas morning ever as a token of his appreciation.<br /><br />With a bigger story (okay some of it re-used) and more characters and a better playground for Kevin, Home Alone 2 manages to be a superior sequel. While not excessively so. There's loads of fun to be had in Kevin's antics and Tim Curry is downright brilliant as the mischievous Concierge. Though try to turn a blind eye to Rob Schneider in his pre-Animal days if you don't dig him.<br /><br />It's a great movie on it's own but sadly it will always be called a copycat. Watch it now from a fresh perspective and you might like it more.<br /><br />Much like the first movie Home Alone 2 is presented 'matted' widescreen. Meaning that if you have seen this a dozen times on video then this version chops off the top and bottom of the frame. Though it was meant to be this way, so worry not. This time round the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture (tho only Region 1 is not anamorphic, sorry) is much better. There are hardly any traces of dirt or scratches and it looks like a proper DVD picture. Unlike the first movie. There is some light grain here and there but that is where the trouble stops.<br /><br />Too bad the Dolby Surround soundtrack is ultra-tame. You'll have to turn your speakers up way past reference level to get a decent sound out of this one. And only then does it sound rather basic. The scenes of Harry and Marv being tortured almost to death could have sounded awesome if there were a rather more sophisticated soundtrack. This almost sounds like a TV movie. Well, no DVD is perfect I guess.<br /><br />Once more the only extras are trailers for all three movies. The effort Fox must have put into this DVD (one of the highest grossing movies ever) must have been backbreaking work.\n",

            "Phobic is not a big-budget studio production, or even a mid-budget indie production. That should be apparent from the credits on the video box, although the extremely negative posts about this film seem to have missed that fact. While consumers of mainly studio fare should probably skip this title, those who take an interest in the passion-fueled world of low-budget film-making may be surprised by the story. There's smart writing, some nice character interaction, and humor as well. I will fault the distributor, though, for marketing this title as a horror film; rather, it is a psychological thriller that relies more on the slow building of suspense than on blood or gore. Its weakest point is the poor lighting, but that is more a reflection of the budget than the story itself. If you see this film, keep these points in mind and you may appreciate what the cast and crew, largely on sweat and tears, managed to accomplish.\n",

            "Well this movie is simply - a waste of time. I only watched it because the reviewer before me said there was comedy in here, but I failed to spot anything, and I mean anything funny - at all. I don't know about you, but I don't really find cheating funny, or a medical stroke, or a car crash, or GBH, and apart from a bad tooth job joke which was on a level of a 3 year old knock knock joke, there was nothing to be called this movie \"comedy\" about.<br /><br />As for the \"drama\" - despite all the above mentioned, I wouldn't even classify this as a drama, its hard to explain unless you see the movie, but all the above bad stuff has been dealt with in the movie so terribly, that you don't even get to feel for the guy, or the girl, or pretty much anyone. And if there is no feelings developed for any of the characters, there is no drama when something happen to them. In fact, the remote sadness I felt was for the 2 second car crash, which was so understated, that you really had no chance to develop even a tear.<br /><br />The story was so badly written, that if you asked me what was the movie about - it was about a (badly written) journal really. The story was, boring and shallow, with ludicrous action points, and final that makes you say \"What the...?\"<br /><br />So, a \"Feel good movie\"? I'm actually feeling very angry now at wasting 1.5 hrs of my life on this. And to top it all it did not help that narrator was Ben's monotonous \"I don't care about anything including this movie\" voice. <br /><br />So all I can say is, I'm off to watch some Lee Evans. Now THAT's a \"comedy\", full of action, passion and feelings: all that this movie - IS NOT!<br /><br />PASS!\n",

            "POSSIBLE SPOILER (If further spoilage is possible) It should take longer for directors to go into decline. A great disappointment after Pola X. He got much more out of Golubova in that film --- maybe her characterization, such as it is, and ultimate fate, in 29 Palms reflects a deterioration in their relationship. <br /><br />Contrary to many comments, the dissatisfaction is not about the slow pace  we still love L'Avventura, Bergman, etc., but when there is nothing to look at in the frame, things become very boring. Narcissists are boring, and neither the director nor the actors (nor the Hummer) show us any complications of interest. It may be news to this French director that the California desert is harsh, the roadside strip malls soulless, but it shouldn't be news that sex can be soulless. No, I don't expect the director to make it erotic, but he shows nothing new about sex or violence to those of us over 10 years old. <br /><br />Some have called this a horror film. Is it the horror of kitsch, of Disneyland, of TV,celebrity culture, of corporate America, of present day politics? Seen it all before. The horror of nothingness?: Been done much better before. This film telegraphs the upcoming horror leadenly --- 15 minutes into it I thought \"Deliverance.\"\n",

This might have been made to honor all the giant bug movies from the 50's, but personally I thought the plot was thin, the premise was formulaic and the whole movie was a little contrived. Typical college kids vs. monster movie. Some bouncing babes, some male to male social conflicts, a legendary cave and a final party for a soon to be married buddy. Add plenty of extra people for fodder and away we go. I have to admit the Indian background characters are a good change. In the final tally, it's still an average SciFi channel small budget movie. Alright for a diversion, but I doubt if I'd rent it. So I give it a 4 out of 10.\n",

Released as \"Betrayed\" in New Zealand, the DVD cover which is a homage to \"Basic Instinct\" is somewhat misleading, for while \"Basic Instinct\" was no masterpiece, it wasn't as terrible as this film. The plot is very weak, the settings plastic, the score terrible and the dialogue cheesy. The leads, Stephen Baldwin and Kristy Swanson are just going through the motions, though they do hold the film together, and Swanson looks very healthy. The rest of the cast are appalling, in particular the actors that play Baldwin's wife and fellow detective.

            "These reviews were given by Moviegoers after recent film festival screenings...they were posted on various web-sites...I hope they don't mind me posting them here.<br /><br />1) I thought this movie was a great depiction of many small town people and their lives when they turn teenagers. Many are so used to being around that small net of people, that they find it difficult to pack up, leave, and follow their own dreams. The Garage does a great job at portraying the life of a kid that is stuck between leaving or staying, and the choice might seem easy to some of us, but we are able to see that it is very difficult. I truly enjoyed this film and could not take my eyes of the screen....<br /><br />2) This is a great movie about the relationship between a father and his adult son. It focuses on the dilemma of the son, Matt, who plans to break away from his home life and find his place in the world. Many things keep happening that keep him from leaving home. He becomes motivated to leave when his friend, who was supposed to go with him, dies. This enables the young man to decide to leave home. Through out the movie, the central theme was the father-son relationship. Not only was the main character struggling to tell his father that he wants to leave home, but, the father of his best friend is violent toward him. The end of the movie wraps this theme up in a way that I thought was unique. It ends by showing the viewer Matt's relationship with his son in the future. Although it is a bit lengthy, the movie is a delightful, yet sad, story about breaking away from the family and finding one's own path.<br /><br />3) The Garage. The fact that the story is a coming of age story set in 1970's small town Texas should not deter you from seeing this film. The cinematography is wonderful, the acting is great, and if you think seeing another film of this genre is close to torture, then you really should see what Carl Thibault has created, breathing fresh, new life into the genre. This film took the SoCal award for Best Screenplay  catch this film at a festival near you to see why<br /><br />4) This film succeeds on so many levels, it is difficult to review. Perhaps it is best to start with what it does not do. While telling an \"every town\" coming-of-age story, the film never succumbs to cliché. Somehow it invokes the \"automobile as vehicle of redemption\" in such a visceral, physical way that you can smell the grease and feel it on your skin. The same film on video would have been a disappointment. The grain of the film itself adds texture. I immediately thought of a dozen people from three generations who I feel need to see this movie--for the simple but heartrending truths it tells, for the reminiscences it stirs, for the music (original and fantastic), and for the acting (surprising given the youth of the actors). Bravo--an American classic.<br /><br />5) Saw this feature film at a festival in CA earlier this year. I really enjoyed it. Growing up in a small town, I could definitely relate to the main character and what was pushing/pulling him. For me, there was something nostalgic about the viewing experience. In my mind, this film is deserving of its many accolades. Bravo indeed.<br /><br />6) Writer/Director Carl Thibault has made a really good film. I just watched this movie at the San Joaquin Film Festival and it blew me away. The basic story is not new. Set in a small town in Texas in the late 70s, the main character, Matt, must make the most important choice of his life. He can stay buried in the going-nowhere job of mechanic in his father's run-down auto repair garage or he can escape to the outside world and rise above the dead end life he's destined for. This film is beautifully photographed, acted, directed, written, edited, and scored. It never has that feel of low budget. Thibault's excellent film is independent cinema at its best. I actually give this picture 4 and a half stars. (out of 5 stars)\n",

            "I was able to only stomach about half an hour of this film before common sense got the best of me and made me press the \"Stop\" button.<br /><br />It seems the producers had plenty of money to throw at this project, just look at the girls they cast in the various lead roles, but all this ends up being is like a sex-charged female-focused adult version of Spy Kids! The gadgets are pitiful, the script is shocking and the overall production makes even the regular sci-fi series look like they spent a mint on them in comparison.<br /><br />Even the attempts of the writers to take the focus off the storyline and replace it with vacuous sexual tension and, as I mentioned, lesbianism is terrible. Not credible in any way shape or form and does nothing for the storyline.<br /><br />I'm not going to tell you to save your money and spend it elsewhere - money can be replaced. Instead I will appeal to you to save yourself wasting the time to even give this film a viewing - you can never get that 30 minutes back!\n",

            "I am not going to give a synopsis, many reviewers already did that very well.<br /><br />I ran into this made-for-TV movie in the sellout-bin from the local videostore. I have to admit I am shallow enough to pick it up, just for the nice pic of Miss Banks on the front. <br /><br />Like most reviewers I did not have any high hopes about the acting ability of a former super- model (I did not know, at that time, of her heartbreaking performance in \"Higher Learning\")<br /><br />I was, however, pleasantly surprised. The chemistry between Lindsay Lohan and Tyra Banks is there. Tyra Banks has great comical&physical talent. Her lanky legs&arms are totally uncoordinated in the beginning, but the longer the doll is human, the better it gets. Small detail, but her initial clumsiness makes a \"living doll\" even somewhat believable.<br /><br />Miss Lohan is, as usual, very professional and convincing as the shocked girl who got something more than she bargained for. The actor playing her dad? Well. He's somewhat annoying with his constant \"smooth lovable talking\". On the other hand, the \"loving Dad\" is something of a standard mainstay in Disney- movies I guess.... Tyra Banks does an admirable job as Eve, the vapid, ever-beautiful doll-girl-with a heart, and her part has some subtle in-jokes about modeling for the grown-ups(f.i. her obsession with food..)and after the initial annoyance with her overdone stupidity in real-life, she started to warm to me. She's utterly charming in the end. But she cannot sing! Sorry to say but there is one little scene that really made me cringe.<br /><br />One thing is obvious. All actors had a great time filming this little for-TV movie, never mind a cohesive story.<br /><br />Yeah..The Story.. Well.. The script is quite inconsistent here and there. (SPOILER ALERT:How come Eve cannot read a Menu OR a computer screen, yet apparently CAN read ingredients on packages when trying to make a cake..with hilarious results...and THEN again is not able to read \"The Book\" ???) but the flow of the story isn't bad. Even though it seems that the script- writers couldn't really decide were to go: More fairy-tale or more real-life. Magic books?? Come on! This isn't Harry Potter!<br /><br />Little niggles like that do not take away anything from the enjoyment of this rather charming movie though. The target audience(family with kids from 8 to 13)will like it, and it has some nice messages about equality of boys&girls strewn in here and there.<br /><br />All in all it is typical, even \"stereo-typical\" Disney run-of-the-mill produce with some cringe-worthy moments, but for the price, quite enjoyable. And the ending? Well, a bit different from what I expected in a Disney-Movie.\n",

I had remembered it as very creepy and scary, but the last time I saw it was when I was 12 or so. I was able to tape it and view several more times now. And as an adult viewer, I have to admit that it's pretty goofy and unconvincing, in that you have to believe some fairly silly, improbable things to get even a slight tingle up the spine from it. (And as a child I never really appreciated how hopelessly racist the film is). There isn't the slightest mystery about what's going on either; unless you're in the clutches of severe Attention Deficit Disorder you know from the get-go who's responsible for all this death and mutilation.

The saccharine sweet narration can be rather vomit inducing at times, however in places it is delivered in a dull, lifeless monotone. The documentary aspect of the film is very shallow indeed as it simply glosses over things and never really actually educates or demonstrates anything, we are just treated to some very basic facts figures over the top of some visuals that are, admittedly, stunning.<br /><br />Some of the cinematography is excellent and I would love to be able to say make the whole experience worthwhile however it suffers from bad editing and staging and a lack of continuity making it obvious that many shots were filmed in various locations nowhere near Red Flag, and during some of the dogfight sequences it's hard to keep track of who is who as the aircraft keep chopping and changing between shots so you have no real idea who is flying what.<br /><br />There is an excessive amount of pyrotechnics used to stage various explosions making the whole affair feel rather fake and forced. Ultimately this isn't a documentary and it isn't a film. It doesn't educate and it doesn't entertain, and it feels like a huge missed opportunity given the access the film crew had to the Red Flag exercises.\n",

            "Most seem to love this movie, so maybe it's my age or something else but I hated it. The story was not well told at all, I had to force myself to stay awake just to make it to the ending. <br /><br />To summarize, Charlie Croker (Michael Caine) wants to rip off a security truck carrying 4 mill. in gold bouillon. There were so many characters that were involved in the heist, but we didn't really get to see what they did. We were just expected to take for granted that these people were the best at there jobs and not actually shown it.<br /><br />Benny Hill made a guest appearance, as the computer genius, but at the beginning of the heist he manages to get himself arrested and we don't see him for the rest of the movie. Charlie Croker goes through a lot of trouble to get this guy on the team, and his disappearance isn't even noticed when it happens. That didn't sit well with me at all. It seems Benny Hill was only added for his name, and to add some comedy; but failed miserably to do so.<br /><br />The ending. Oh dear the ending. I get that they were trying to be brilliant with the whole anticlimax thing (Did they succeed or not? We're not going to tell you because that wouldn't be artistic) Personally I think that's just pretentious garbage that even if the rest of the movie was done well I would still hate it. Any movie in this genre needs an ending or else it makes the viewer, at least this viewer, feel as though they just wasted two hours of their life.<br /><br />I normally love movies of this kind, especially those made in the sixties and seventies. And I looovvveee Michael Caine's work. But this one should be left alone. It was terrible.\n",

            "I first saw this show live with the same cast as in the movie (With the exception of the Soprano who played Mabel) in Adelaide, South Australia, for my 16th birthday. I loved it then and I love it now. Poor Frederic is the slave of duty and although he has lived 21 years is in fact a little boy of 5. Knowing this, he must return to the pirate band until 1940 and his Mabel promises to wait for him.<br /><br />The show is very camp and the gags are hilarious, although some of them are very topical. Jon English plays to the audience as much as he does on the stage to great effect and the audience participation is well worth the fun.<br /><br />I have only just managed to get a new copy of this production after having worn the old video out.....lol.

In addition to the warm, caring relationships, Winger finds happiness with a school associate and marriage pursues.<br /><br />How terrible that one of her children was a victim of the Columbine Massacre.

            "Kirk Wong's \"The Big Hit\" of 1998 has a funny premise - a professional killer who happens to be the friendliest guy one could imagine. And it is a funny film occasionally, but it also annoys with its constant attempt of being the hippest movie ever made, and partly seems like an overlong rap-video, which is more than tiring after a while. There are some hilarious sequences, but, unfortunately, the annoying ones overwhelm.<br /><br />Melvin Smiley (Mark Wahlberg)is a professional assassin. And he is a really, really nice guy. Actually, he is such a nice guy that he is just being used by his two smoking hot girlfriends (played by Christina Applegate and Lela Rochon), and most of his hit-men buddies also hoodwink him whenever they can...<br /><br />...These hit-men friends are played by Lou Diamond Phillips, Bookeem Woodbine and Antonio Sobato Jr., and although I wouldn't necessarily say that any of their performances sucked big time, they are not really worth mentioning either, and neither is the performance of Wahlberg himself. OK, Lou Diamond Phillips is quite funny at times, but as often as his character is funny, he is also annoying, simply because he is too exaggerated and stereotypical. Christina Applegate and Lela Rochon make a good looking female supporting cast, one of the few truly good performances however, is delivered by the beautiful China Chow, who plays the daughter of a rich Japanese businessman in the female lead. The supporting cast includes Elliot Gould, who, not surprisingly, delivers the best performance in the film, and Avery Brooks, who also fits in quite well as the hit-men's boss.<br /><br />\"The Big Hit\" is an endurable time-waster if you really have nothing better to do, but over-all the attempts of being the 'cooooolest' film that ever hit the screen are just too annoying to really have a good time. This film was produced by cult director John Woo. John Woo was a brilliant filmmaker in his Hong Kong days, with great titles such as \"A Better Tomorrow\", \"The Killer\" or \"Bullet In The Head\", but at the latest since after the passable \"Face/Off\", his name is connected with blockbusters that barely reach mediocrity, such as \"The Big Hit\". What a pity.\n",

            "Winning combination of scattershot comedy and wry, wistful drama tells the (alleged) true story of a milkman with big dreams and no money who is curiously named a recipient in the will of multi-millionaire Howard Hughes. Melvin Dummar (played by Paul LeMat, in a terrific performance) had been saying all along he once helped out an old guy in the desert near Las Vegas who claimed he was Hughes, but Dummar didn't really believe him (they had a nice chat anyway, and Melvin got Howard to sing one of his self-written novelty songs as well as \"Bye Bye Blackbird\"). Good-natured film directed by Jonathan Demme rarely loses its way, and features an endearing collection of screwballs who make the loopy craziness of the situations and dialogue immediate and real--their eccentricities are the roots of the story. Mary Steenburgen won a Supporting Oscar as Dummar's first wife, a dreamer like Melvin who is far less satisfied with struggling and who just wants to amount to something (but to Melvin, the struggles are the best part). Jason Robards is perfect as Hughes; the normally bombastic actor takes a small role and lets it bloom subtly and beautifully for us, giving the movie a misty hue and making all of Melvin's hopes sweetly credible. ***1/2 from ****\n",

            "There used to be a time when Star Wars was the best thing since sliced bread. Of course I was about 7 then but nonetheless it was the ultimate for many people of my generation, and then we grew up but perhaps it is that I have grown up that I didn't enjoy this one wanting a film for adults. I entered the cinema expecting some good old fashioned galatic action despite the let down of the Phantom Menace but instead what I got was two hours of largely tedium.<br /><br />At base level all the ingredients were there but there was nothing else, this film was completely empty at heart. What the original movies had in charm, in script and in the endearing performance of their cast (even Mark Hamill pulled it off in the end) was largely lacking here. The two leads of Christensen and Portman cannot act to save their lives, sadly in this movie their lives were saved and we'll have to experience more of their slushy badly scripted romance in the third. They have all the physical chemistry onscreen of a couple of neutered dogs.<br /><br />The depth of their romance which is one of the central planks of the movie is comparable to an infants swimming pool, clearly George Lucas has been reading too much Mills and Boon and spent way too long on his special effects computers to remember just how humans work.<br /><br />The supporting cast headed by Macgregor are patchy too though Macgregor is head and shoulders above the two teenage leads and at times manage to act with some gusto. Much has been said about Christopher Lee and Samuel L Jackson but they are just playing themselves being competent enough actors to just turn up for work and perform regardless of what he director says. Compared to their past performances they are both underwhelming too.<br /><br />I've already mentioned the love aspect of the story, this was also supposed to be a dark plot with plenty of evil and of course Anakin turning to the dark-side. For what is supposed to be the defining moment of the entire series we get a whole three minutes of screentime where he kills people. As to get a PG rating the slaughter is glossed over and barely shown on camera it's left to the actor to communicate what happened but the evil growing in him is completely skirted around with a little bit of sobby stuff that simply isn't convincing - at no time do we see someone being corrupted by power which is really a lost opportunity.<br /><br />Lost opportunities is what this film is full of though, inside is a really good story struggling to get out but the issues are dumbed down to make them suitable for children to understand. The lack of invention in it is also stunning, why introduce Jango Fett at all except to cash in on the popularity of Boba Fett, why have Kenobi hide behind an asteroid like Han Solo does in Empire Strikes Back with a star destroyer? Why did we get those terrible C3PO puns and what was it with Yoda ever having a walking stick if he can fight like a whirling dervish on speed? Why does a changeling keep it's face and not get a new one then try to kill Kenobi.<br /><br />The only part of the script I did appreciate was the ever annoying Jar Jar being the cause of the rise of the Empire, ooh the irony. Script aside Star Wars has always been something of an effects movie but these days it's simply not impressive enough when compared to Lord of the Rings. The saturation of the colours throughout the film make it all look cartoony, and the CGI does look like CGI although it is much improved on the previous film with Yoda at last looking real. I imagine this is where the majority of the work went on the film but it's just not good enough. I do wish that Lucas would get back to the gritty colour tones used in the first two films, they certainly added to the realism but the Disney look seems to have infected the franchise too deeply.<br /><br />Not only are many of the effects lacking any believability but Lucas can't direct action, something that is a major flaw in a film that has perhaps half of it as action scenes. We get lasers zapping everywhere but there is no coherence with the editing and it all ends up a bit confusing with none of the excitement that should be there.<br /><br />The problem with editing recurs throughout the film with the love story intercut with the discovery of the clone army badly done, why do we keep coming back from an interesting story to one that just turns people off, something that was obvious in the cinema as you could hear people groan everytime the teenage lovers were on.<br /><br />The sound though is superb, watching at home on my Dolby 5:1 did make it a bit more of an experience but if you are relying on technical details to carry a film then you really shouldn't be making it to start with. Anyone can buy a decent sound engineer for a movie, and just be limited by budget but not anyone can get a good performance out of an actor, then the limit is talent.<br /><br />Let's face it that George Lucas is nothing more than a glorified technician being way past his limits is trading on the goodwill of fans from movies he did 25 years ago. He's no great director or writer and should leave that to others, perhaps then we can get the Star Wars movies that we all want, and perhaps he can come to rival the grosses of the old films again but I fear the magic will have gone by then. score - 4/10 for sentimental reasons.\n",

In his autobiography, \"Cagney By Cagney\" Mr. Cagney told of many actual events in Mr. Chaney's life that were used in the picture and one in particular that was so sad they decided not to include it. Although loosely based on the life of Lon Chaney, Sr. I still felt the producers used enough actual events in Mr. Chaney's life to convey to the viewers what a truly talented man he was. Also, the tremendous challenges he faced being the son of deaf and mute parents. This is an excellent movie that stands up well through the years.\n",

It has some pretty cool people in it: Neve Campbell, Matthew Broderick, and Andy Dick. So anyway, Simba and Nala kind of take over from their parents and Simba's really proud. The same basic characters as in the first one are in it, like Timon and Pumpa. There's still lots of conflict like Simba's daughter gets into trouble and stuff. It's all much better to watch when you're a kid, though. I think it's worth 1.50 and no more but I'm kids and some other people would actually like it. It's just that I love the first one so much that this one just doesn't compare at all. It also doesn't have the same emotional feel that the first had (with the father dying and such). The first one always made me cry even when I was older plus the music and visuals were cool so it made it a really good film but this one isn't. I just wish they hadn't made a sequel.

Then you get talked into doing a needless sequel to your big hit, only a few years ago. Well that's what happened to Sidney J. Furie. In an attempt to tell a more serious, or adult story Furie reject everything about the first film that made it work. Instead he chose to take all the fun out of the film with in the first few minutes of the picture. The first film was more of a Teen movie, it stood out because of that fact. It was fun and energetic, but this one is dry and slow. As a stand alone film, it's sort of boring. As part of the Iron Eagle franchise, it's down right depressing. First it's about the US and Russia teaming up on a mission to stop some terrorist from launching a nuclear bomb, but it never really is clear why one or the other can't just take on the mission by themselves. The characters seem either cardboard flat, or outright dumb. The biggest mistake they make is the under use of Louis Gossett Jr. His character doesn't seem to really have a place, except standing around and barking orders. He never seems to have the same energy as he did in the first film. The ending was fine, if not reminiscent of Star Wars. The contrived Love story didn't work at all for me, it felt like they were again trying to take the story into more adult territory and in that lost the point of what makes the first one so good...\n",

            "Well, here's another outing for the tissue-tribe. One of the many utterly talentless casting-couch queens of the 1980's, Daryl Hannah, plays her predictable screen persona as the vulnerable naiveté in a hu-man's world (check-out 'Crazy People'). This movie doesn't contain clichés; it is a cliché.<br /><br />Strangely popular one-dimensional Tom Hanks plays it straight against various odd-ball individuals including his huckster brother, acted by the continuously upstaging John Candy, with a little pythonesque humour supplied by a female employee who has had a bump on the head and is now in the habit of wearing her clothes out of synch. Then later, he's up against a marine-biologist with a fascist turn, attempting to expose Ms Hannah's fishy secret, of which he - Hanks - is as yet unaware (she's a mermaid, you see).<br /><br />It would appear that on dry land, her fishy lower-half turns into a human and most excellent pair of pins with the sundry anatomy between -so long as they stay dry. But that if they don't get a regular soaking, they'll remain as legs forever, and she will be forced to stay on land. Or something like that. <br /><br />Candy can be hilarious in the right scenario - check-out 'Planes,Trains & Automobiles'. Hanks? I can only conclude that he spent some time on a very influential casting-couch as well. <br /><br />Darly Hannah has the face and figure to have most unemancipated males -or most males, in other words - embarrassed by the scale of their spontaneous erections. She is definitely the stuff of an evolutionary 'trophy' wife. And we get to see a great deal of her meat in this movie. <br /><br />Then, of course, she gets to do most anything she likes, whether it be wandering about stark naked, going on a buying spree at another's expense, or destroying a shop full of TV sets. She gets to do this because she's 'pretty' and 'vulnerable' and 'naive'. Yawn. <br /><br />Some people see it as a 'romance'. But I offer this bi-line: Ms Hannah's character - or Madison, as she calls herself - is a mermaid, and therefor not only a different species but also a supposedly dangerous one of ancient folklore. And we learn that she has been stalking Hanks's character like some paedophilic pariah ever since he was a child. Naturally, she has waited until he is adult before taking her pursuit onto dry land, but the implication is self-evident. She uses sex to ensnare him (and a great deal of it, as the dialogue makes clear) in order to subvert him to her way of life. It's a life of immortality but from which he can never, ever escape (though he doesn't yet know it whilst he's submitting to her therapy).<br /><br />Am I the only one who can see the parallels with 'Dracula' in that resume? I put this to any viewer: would the scenario be quite so 'romantic' if the seducer were male? Because then the parallel with 'Dracula' would be complete. <br /><br />Only at the last moment, on the dockside, when she has won him over and he has cravenly agreed to join her in her oceanic world, does she spring on him the deadly caveat that there will be no going back; when he joins her, it is for ever. <br /><br />I suspect that if the gender-tables were turned, any male would be regarded as the most consummate manipulator and fraud under the same circumstances.<br /><br />However; if paedophilia, bestiality, and betrayal are your idea of the ingredients for a good romance, then keep taking the tissues.\n",

            "The Winning Season is a fantasy which initially focuses on a 12 year old Little Leaguer, Joe Soshack, whose parents are always bickering due to the father's lack of success as a breadwinner. While not stated explicitly, Joe's lack of confidence as a Little Leaguer is linked to the family's dire economic circumstances.<br /><br />Joe earns extra money doing chores for Mrs. Young, an elderly woman in the neighborhood. He hopes to buy a 1971 Willie Stargell baseball card who a local baseball card memorabilia dealer has reserved for him at a discount price. Mrs. Young offers him a few bucks to clean out her attic and when Joe finds an extremely rare and valuable Honus Wagner baseball card, he runs home without telling Mrs. Young he's found the card. When his parents tell him that he must return the card, in a fit of greed, Joe grabs his bicycle and pedals off to the local little league field, presumably now a runaway.<br /><br />At this point in the film, I'm reminded a bit of The Wizard of Oz. Dorothy also runs away because her parental figures don't \"understand\" her; the same with Joe. But where Dorothy is upset because Miss Gulch has taken Toto away, Joe swipes the Honus Wagner Card more out of basic selfishness. Although he claims he's doing it for his family so they can escape the financial bind they're in, the impulsive act pegs Joe more as a spoiled brat and wholly an unsympathetic character for most of the film. The whole idea is that Joe is simply immature but given the high moral principles the parents live by, I would have thought that he wouldn't have been so selfish.<br /><br />Time travel fantasies need a clever way for the protagonist to travel back in time. In Back to the Future, Marty travels back in time in a retrofitted DeLorean car. In 'The Winning Season', there's nothing clever in the way Joe goes back in time. He merely stares at the 'magical' Honus Wagner Card and poof, he's back in 1909 right in the middle of the World Series between the Pirates and the Detroit Tigers. And strangely, Joe is no longer 12 year old Joe; he's 25 year old Joe. There's no explanation for the transformation but without it, the film's scenarist will not be able to pull of the clumsy scene in the film's denouement, when Joe takes the place of Honus in the last game of the 1909 World Series.<br /><br />Whereas the real Honus Wagner was the son of German immigrants and very much a rough and tumble character of his day, Matthew Modine plays him as a generic good guy. Just about the only truly historical fact we learn about Honus Wagner was that he refused to cooperate with a tobacco company who wanted to use his image on baseball cards which they hoped to use in promoting their product. One would have hoped for a more nuanced portrait of Wagner, but the film's scenarist placed him on a pedestal.<br /><br />In reality, Honus married in 1894 and had three daughters. But in 'The Winning Season', his true love is 'Mandy' who ends up breaking up with him after believing that his true love is baseball. While we find out little about the real life Honus Wagner, we find out next to nothing about the fictional Mandy, a wasted part played by a ditsy Kristin Davis.<br /><br />The antagonist here is Ty Cobb. While Cobb was known for being overly aggressive on the field and having a bad reputation amongst his fellow ballplayers, he's turned into a virtual criminal when he attempts to blackmail Joe after stealing the Honus Wagner baseball card. Cobb extorts Joe into preventing Honus from playing in the last game of the World Series (it seems highly out of character for the highly competitive Cobb to prevent his arch-rival from competing against him in any game, let alone the World Series!). Joe taking off in the car and leaving Wagner stranded, makes him even more unlikeable (despite the soon and expected redemption!).<br /><br />Most engaging baseball films involve the focus on one particular moment in a game where the protagonist helps his team go on to victory. In the charming \"It Happens Every Spring\", Ray Milland, helps his team win the championship by catching a ball with his bare hand; it's an instinctive act of self-sacrifice as he breaks his hand in the process. Unlike that dramatic moment of sacrifice, there's a completely awkward moment in 'The Winning Season' where Joe goes out on the field pretending he's Honus (he can't even fit into Honus's uniform) and no one notices the deception except Ty Cobb.<br /><br />The ending to 'The Winning Season' is utterly predictable. When Joe returns to the present day 1985, he's 'learned his lesson' and is no longer a self-centered brat. What's more he's become confident (due to the tutelage of the angelic Honus Wagner) and now hits a home run, helping his team win the championship and confound all the kids who've been heckling him as a wimp.<br /><br />There's a final canard thrown in where Mrs. Young turns out to be the embittered Mandy who on her deathbed regrets breaking up with Honus. Now Joe is willing to make a 'sacrifice' by giving up the magical Honus card which Mandy uses to return to 1909 where she shacks up with Honus. All well and good but if that happened, history would have turned out differently and the young Joe would never have met the spinster Mrs. Young in the first place.<br /><br />'The Winning Season' admirably attempts to recreate the look of the \"Dead Ball\" era but as other reviewers have pointed out, little attempt has been made to be historically accurate (yes, why do the Detroit fans cheer when Pittsburgh wins the Series?). 'The Winning Season' could have been something really clever but settles for scenes of predictable sentimentality.\n",

You can watch his work and tell if he likes the script. He can be a very high caliber, talented actor but he basically just went through the motions on this one. There was a nice chemistry between Fendley and Brigette Neilson, it's to bad that they didn't have more time to work together on the film. The story plot of this film lacked and the directing and editing were also sub par. Speaking of Directing, I've also seen improvement in Donald Farmers work as a director.

            "Peter O'Toole, who's been known to take an occasional drink himself, probably had a lot of experience to bring to the part of Alan Swann, swashbuckling movie star of bygone years who's gone to seed. O'Toole has a tax problem and he's agreed to do an appearance on a top rated television comedy show of the Fifties to satisfy Uncle Sam's lien on his future income and to avoid deportation. But by now he's a boozy shadow of his former self and the star of the show Joseph Bologna assigns his most junior writer, Mark Linn-Baker to keep him in reasonable condition to perform.<br /><br />As it turns out it means bringing O'Toole into his world which is Jewish Brooklyn of the Fifties, something I'm somewhat familiar with myself. Baker and O'Toole become a marvelous comedy duo themselves here. I'm surprised they did not team to do a whole lot more films than this. <br /><br />O'Toole's performance succeeds on a lot of levels. Yes it's pretty funny, sidesplittingly funny at times. But there's also an element of sadness in it as well. You see in film clips the man O'Toole once was and now only commands attention by making a public spectacle of himself at times. I knew someone like that in my life, one who hardly had any kind of a career, but also HAD to be the center of attention at all times and usually did it by getting riotously drunk and acting abominably dumb. He had a certain charm and could get away with it, a lot though not the way O'Toole does.<br /><br />Based on Mel Brooks's recollections of having to work with Errol Flynn, the film lets you know it's Flynn were remembering. Note the almost step by step choreographed duel recreation of Flynn and Basil Rathbone's final duel from The Adventures of Robin Hood. <br /><br />Joseph Bologna is great as the egotistical comedy star and the Brooklyn vignette has a great performance by Lainie Kazan as Baker's most Jewish mother and Lou Jacobi as his most Jewish uncle.<br /><br />Still it's what goes on and what's between O'Toole and Baker that makes My Favorite Year an all time comedy classic.\n",

A group of young hackers create some trouble until they find out about an evil plot. Then it becomes a bad action, romance hybrid... with outdated computers... that never existed.<br /><br />Indeed, the movie hackers breaks at least two dozen fundamental pieces of computer knowledge that anybody even moderately trained could catch. Most of these somehow involve over the top dramatic camera angles and cut-away.

            "I am not someone who insists that a movie adhere strictly to the book on which it is based. Moreover, I recognize that a teleplay must omit some parts of the book in order to fit in an 80-minute timeframe. However, I expect the essential theme of the book to be maintained. This adaptation fails miserably in that respect.<br /><br />Rather than paint a picture of the futility of playing God, writer Alan Sharp and director Philip Haas chose to give us a one-dimensional cliché of the self-aggrandizing scientist (James Caan's Dr. Haber) and us a shallow love story. Haber's desire to mold a better world through George Orr's power, his attempt to convince George to join him in the effort rather than resist, and his inability to see that the consequences of meddling with reality are unpredictable -- all of this is lost in Haas' adaptation. Instead, we see Haber using George to obtain successively more magnificent office space and a progressively more fashionable secretary. George's love interest, Heather, is reduced to an odd obsession; Heather's own attempt (and failure) in LeGuin's novel to use George's power for public good never appears in Haas' film.<br /><br />Perhaps the pettiest departure from the book was Sharp and Haas' choice to have Dr. Haber say \"New York\" (instead of \"Antwerp\") as the phrase that induces George Orr's dreams under hypnosis in their first session. Interestingly, Haber never uses the phrase again in any of the subsequent dream scenes. Maybe Haas was embarrassed by his own pettiness.<br /><br />Even as a standalone movie, this film is a poor one. Lisa Bonet's character, Heather, was completely unbelievable. Are we really supposed to accept that a successful and self-assertive lawyer will drive out to a remote location and jump into bed with a psychiatric patient about whom she knows very little and that she will remain there with him for days in the face of his increasingly obsessive behavior - simply because he says he feels he knew her from a previous life? In another scene, we are given hints that George's friend, Manny, may be more than he seems. He appears in each of George's realities, and he seems to recall all of them. Yet the film does nothing with this; it is simply a loose string left for us to puzzle on. The final scenes are rushed and confusing, leaving the viewer with the sense that Haas simply ended the show in order to fit into the time he had available.<br /><br />Philip Haas has not made a decent movie since his 1995 `Angels and Insects.' This version of `The Lathe of Heaven' continues his streak of losers. If you want to see a good film adaptation of LeGuin's book, buy the 1980 PBS version instead.\n",

            "Somebody smart once said something to the effect if there is a need for a prologue, than director did not do his job correctly. I cannot agree more. Unfortunately Go West spends first two and a half minutes on prologue, boring prologue to be precise. Completely unnecessary. From there on, the movie spends more time on unnecessary details, more voice from the off, more explanations of unnecessary details, watering down the film I am sure would mean a lot if done as it should.<br /><br />It must have been hard to come up with the idea of two homosexuals running away from the Sarajevo, because Sarajevo was never eager on homosexuals. I have spent there more than half of my life and I have met only two openly gay man. Compare that to my current place of living where I know at least a dozen openly gay man. Attacking homophobia in Sarajevo is very dangerous and brave undertaking, and for that I need to congratulate Ahmed Imamovic and Enver Puska. That was brave. Unfortunately brave writers and directors do not equal a great movie. However, this one is a good movie, a bit clumsy in some areas, but overall quite watchable.<br /><br />If you expect something like Queer as Folk, than you will be disappointed. No sex scenes to that level. I guess because actors and the rest of the crew were quite scared for touching the topic. Well, that would be all but Tarik Filipovic, one of two main actors, who played homosexual in another Bosnian movie, dark comedy \"Dobro Ustimani Mrtvaci\". I guess the fact he lives in Zagreb, Croatia gives him more freedom to take on roles that bring hate mail and death threats that could eventuate into something awful if he was living near those who wrote them.<br /><br />Watching this movie will annoy you. Sometimes the characters do not act as sane people would, and everything is a bit stretched, but this movie has other good points and is important maybe not as a great movie, but as a first movie that tackles homosexual love in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n",

To the role of God, one challenging to any mortal actor, he brought a sense of immense love and transformation brought on by that love. The image of him putting his arm around an aged and exhausted Moses as the Israelites hit Jericho without their leader was one of compassionate friendship. This is what we're told God felt for Moses.<br /><br />Hey, 10-cent cigars in Heaven! There is so much in this about what Heaven might have meant to people in a different time, a different condition.

Jiya causes a scene during their engagement party accusing the other girl of loving her finance and her finance loving her. Then she demands to know what he feels for her, and he goes and dumps the red powder on her head and proclaims her his wife.

            "I have seen several TV/film adaptations of this story, and this is by far the worst. For a start there's the central character, who lacks any of the charisma of Conan Doyle's creation. He shoots up with drugs in public toilets, he beats up and threatens cabbies - it all seems too much like the makers of this new adaption are desperately trying to get an audience, but might have been happier making episodes of Eastenders. Parts of the story are ignored completely. And as for the hound itself - it looks nothing like a dog, even one that's been brutally treated all its life. More like an escapee from 'Walking With Beasts'. It's not a total flop, however. Watson (played by Ian Hart) is at last an intelligent doctor rather than the bumbling idiot he's usually portrayed as, and Richard E.Grant makes for a sly, scheming Stapleton. However, you'd be much better off watching the far superior Basil Rathbone, Peter Cushing and Ian Richardson versions.\n",

The only upside was the story was good , but not good enough to make this movie a favorite.Also , Robin Willaims was not the voice of the genie which was another downside.<br /><br />The main plot is Jafar escapes from the lamp and wants revenge on Aladdin , and Iago escapes and becomes good and helps Aladdin defeat Jafar. I don't have a favorite song because I don't like any of them. If you see this in stores , and start to think if you should buy it or not , I say , don't.<br /><br />4/10\n",

            "May I be so bold as to put one of the most annoying misconceptions in all of filmdom to restthis movie is NOT about Janis Joplin. It is NOT based on Janis Joplin's life; it is NOT about a Janis Joplin-like character. The only similarity between the character Mary Rose Foster and Janis Joplin is that they were both female rock singers. The occupational hazard of drug and alcohol abuse is so ubiquitous in this genre that it can hardly be said to implicate Ms. Joplin as opposed to virtually any other female rock singer. Why no one says this movie is about Grace Slick, Stevie Nicks, or Joan Baez, I don't know, but it bears no more resemblance to Janis Joplin than it does to any of these other women. Bette Midler's \"Rose\" is truly an enormously talented woman, but she does not look, sound, dress, speak, act, sing or dance like Janis Joplin. Janis Joplin was not prone to getting into fights with people in public, stealing limousines, trespassing in steam baths, she was not from Florida, she was not asking to take a year off, she was not being manipulated by some evil Svengali manager, and she did not return to her home town to do one total blow out concert and subsequently drop dead on stage. I suppose it does not help that misinformed boobs like George Mair continue to perpetuate this nonsense in biographies of Ms. Midler, but no matter how frequently a fallacy is repeated or by how learned of an individual, it does not make it so. So to sum it up in plain English, THIS MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT JANIS JOPLIN.<br /><br />I think perhaps people are so eager to jump to this conclusion because without it, it is admittedly difficult to figure out exactly what this movie IS about. I'll leave that question to subsequent reviewers who care to dig beyond the surface cliché that this movie is about Janis Joplin, which I believe we have now clearly established, it is not. Would I recommend it? If you love Bette Midler, yes. If you're a fan of Janis Joplin, see the documentary \"Janis\" instead.\n",

            "I usually enjoy Sam Peckinpah films, but this slow paced, meandering meditation on the decline of the West just never sparked my interest. There's an excellent cast, great music, stunning cinematography, terrific production design ... all the ingredients are there, but it never came alive for me.<br /><br />The performances are so understated that the characters have no definition. Kristofferson plays Billy the Kid and James Coburn his friend turned nemesis, Sheriff Pat Garrett. It takes two hours for Garrett and Billy to have their final showdown; in the process they drift languidly through one laconic scene after another. There's a fair amount of gunplay, with the by now banal slow motion deaths, but even the action sequences lack fire.<br /><br />This is ultimately a meditative, brooding film, which is probably the idea; but it's just too plodding for my taste.<br /><br />One trivial gripe: whatever they used for blood in this picture struck me as some of the fakiest I've ever seen. It looks exactly like plain red paint. It's actually a distraction, detracting from the impact of the action scenes. It's the one aspect of the production design that rings a false note.\n",

            "I feel compelled to comment on this movie, since the other comments presented here must have been made by people involved with the film. This movie is beyond bad. I saw a preview screening of it at Horrorfind Weekend back in 2004. Now, granted, it was an unfinished version of the film, but it remains the first, and only, movie that I have ever walked out of. I was not the only one thinking, \"abort! abort!\" either, as at least half of the audience had left by the time I made my way out.<br /><br />The plot (what there was of it) involved a construction crew uncovering ancient Indian artifacts, one of which is a metal tube of apparently alien origin. Two different sides then vie for possession of the tube, the first comprised of an archaeologist, a shot-first-and-never-ask-questions cop (Savini, the only \"actor\" of note in this film), and a \"mysterious\" (read: boring) vigilante who may or may not be an alien. The second is a gang whose members don't die very easily and their alien leader, though no one seems to really care or notice that he's an alien.<br /><br />The overall premise is okay, but the execution falls completely flat. The director, in his introduction before the film, stated that his intent was to make something of a \"moving graphic novel set to music\" (I'm paraphrasing). Well, one has to remember that, in a graphic novel, the sections with no dialogue or narration can be taken in in about thirty seconds, literally. In the movie, they drag on for about five to ten straight minutes. It's as if the movie wasn't long enough, so the director decided to throw in two or three music videos in order to lengthen this clunker.<br /><br />The script, while horribly convoluted and needlessly confusing, is bearable. The actors, however, fail to play their parts, but they more read them to the camera and each other. Savini, who we all know is not an actor by trade, is unfortunately the best one on display here. The rather ham-fisted editing further adds to confusion, with sequences ending to suddenly, settings changing without proper establishment, and events being referred to which the audience never saw take place (though, this may be since I saw an incomplete version).<br /><br />I sometimes question where filmmakers such as these get the money for there productions, as I'm sure a much better movies are floating around looking for financing. Do yourself a favor and track down a little known good movie, one that holds your interest as opposed to being so ridiculous and mind numbing as to make an avid movie-goer abandon ship halfway through.\n",

            "John Ford directed a very interesting film with all kinds of suspense along with the story written by the famous Eugene O'Neill. This story takes place on a freighter, \"Glencairn\", along with a great cast of veteran actors who are all individuals with many years of sailing experiences and some are just plain rough and tough and others keep to themselves. John Wayne, (Ole Olsen) plays the role of a Swedish seaman who wants to make this voyage on the Glencairn his last, because he wants to go home to his mother's farm near Stockholm, Sweden. Wayne does not play a very big role in this film in spite of the fact he has star billing. Thomas Mitchell, (Aloysuis Driscoll) plays the role as the senior man and gives a great supporting role. Even Ward Bond appears and has a relatively short role in this picture. This picture takes place during WW II and the Glencairn has hidden on board lots of ammunition to support the war effort in England and could be destroyed by German planes or submarines. Nice film, but not what I expected to see.\n",

            "The Whitman brothers haven't seen each other in over a year. Francis (Owen Wilson) invites his brother Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schartzman) on a cross-country train trip through the heartland of India in order to reconnect, bond and find themselves on a spiritual level. That's their internal arc. The external arc is to reunite with their mother who is now working as a nun in a convent at the \"foot of the Himalayas\".<br /><br />The Darjeeling Limited is actually a run-down train, the kind you would find in just about any third world landscape. The Darjeeling Limited (the Movie) attempts to mix farce with scenes of dramatic pathos unsuccessfully. For most of the movie, the three brothers are depicted as losers with a ton of emotional baggage, unable to resolve grudges they hold from an unfulfilled childhood. Unlike the Three Stooges (who mainly depended on quirky physical routines), there's little to distinguish the three witless Whitmans. Francis is the goofy businessman who spends most of the movie with his head wrapped in bandages after getting into a motorcycle accident prior to hooking up with his brothers; Peter is ostensibly running away from the responsibilities of adulthood as his wife is now 7 ½ months pregnant back home; and Jack is a struggling writer with a propensity for casual sex (he easily beds a stewardess on the train). Note there is a 13 minute short film on the DVD entitled \"Hotel Chevalier\" which illustrates the ending of Jack's pretentious novel.<br /><br />Act I concerns the brothers' unfunny vignettes aboard the Darjeeling Limited. The main bit concerns their smuggling a poisonous snake aboard the train which almost gets them thrown off by the conductor. Eventually, Peter accuses Francis of being an \"Indian giver\" after he takes back an expensive belt he had given him earlier. They get into a physical altercation which spills out into the passenger section. This finally gets the hapless siblings thrown off the train in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />Act II switches to a rural Indian area where the brothers witness the capsizing of a raft manned by a group of boys. The brothers jump into the river, save two of the children but are unable to save a third. The brothers are about to take a bus but are suddenly invited by the villagers to attend the boy's funeral. Obviously, this is the scene where the brothers are supposed to 'grow up' and the audience is supposed to sympathize with them. In better screenplays, moments of sympathy for the protagonists come much earlier (usually at the beginning of the story). Here, the rescue of the children occurs at the midpoint of the film and it seems out of place with Act One's slapstick tone.<br /><br />Act III reunites the brothers with their mother, the nun in the convent played by Anjelica Huston. There's a lame joke about an escaped tiger eating one of the nun's brothers followed by the mother making breakfast for the brothers and then disappearing. Unperturbed, the brothers go up to the mountain and bond with one another. The final scene reprises the first: the brothers just miss the departing Darjeeling Limited and must jump on board just as the train pulls out of the station.<br /><br />The performances here are uniformly forgettable. The usually grim Adrien Brody should be singled out for proving that he's unfit for comedy. The leering Jason Schwartzman does his Ron Jeremy imitation and Owen Wilson takes a pratfall or two. Finally, there's the director, Wes Anderson, who must be castigated not only for his self-indulgence but for having a sense of humor that is thoroughly juvenile in tone and scope. Let's hope that some of the film's bloated budget went to helping some of the indigent local population who assisted the crew while working on this film. The true star of this misguided production was the Indian countryside and its people whose earnestness is contrasted with the shallowness of the film's creators.\n",

            "In a nutshell so that you don't have to read the rest of my crap if you don't want to: Old story. Aliens are having problems in their world and so they come to ours to bug us or take over, or something. I dunno. So an alien agent is sent to stop them from their diabolical schemes.<br /><br />When not chairing the \"Iron Chef\" Mark Dacascos. does action B-movies which are, in my opinion, usually better than most B-movies but yet always seem to fall just short of their potential. This one is no exception. All the pieces are there; just needed a little bit more intelligence in the writing and better direction. Case in point: our hero steals a police car and was asked by his companion why he did it. He replied that he wanted to hear the police reports. This was so obviously a lame excuse since the cost of attracting so much attention to himself far outweighed the benefits. Besides, he could simply have used or gotten a scanner of his own (he had a hideout full of crap). More likely the director wanted a car chase and this was his best excuse to get one. In another scene a lot of people were killed for no good reason other than to steal a truck. Why would you do that and draw unwanted attention to yourself? More likely the director needed a mass murder at this juncture and this was his best excuse for one. I wanted to like this movie, and I did \"somewhat\" (I liked the early scene with the alien chick on the overpass; at that point the movie looked very promising) but there were some inconsistencies that bugged me. In the first fight scene the hero fought very well; expertly. Then there was a later fight scene where he appeared to not know how to fight at all. If the director wanted the bad guy to get the better of him he could have done it without making him look like he forgot how to fight altogether (he basically stood there and took an ass whipping).<br /><br />Dacascos obviously is a talented martial artist. More so than Van Damme or Seagal. And yet -as luck or fate would have it- never achieved even their level of success. Ironic that he's probably better known from a cooking show than from what he does best. Kick ass. Ahh well, life has a sense of humor. All I can say for Alien Agent is that it's better than most B-movies which may or may not be saying much. Why don't you be the judge? Love, Boloxxxi.\n",

It's a brilliantly delivered story of the men and women who contributed to the greatest historical event in my lifetime. Probably the greatest since Columbus, nearly 500 years earlier. It tells very much a human story of the people and families of those involved. The test pilots from the early jet age, the very real risks that they took and the selection of the few to enter the space programme. I was upset to discover that the great Chuck Yeager was not chosen because he was not \"of the officer class\" or \"education standard\". Something like that as far as I can recall.

I'll just copy that.' It's Scorsese imitating himself and not doing a very good job of it. The editing is quick and choppy like in Goodfellas but too much so the whole film is like one big montage with very little innovative direction. DeCaprio and Damon aren't great but neither are they bad, they just suffice. The actors that really shine are Mark Walberg, who finally ditches the breathless, confused moron he usually plays and does something way different and innovative with himself. Alec Baldwin is fantastic he has some of the best lines and is an actor who just seems to be getting better with age. Normally I'd say the same for Jack who's performance in 'As Good As It Gets', was groundbreaking but this time he's just playing The Joker in Batman he's too over the top for such a seriously acted movie. He was also made too nasty, just to make us dislike him with no seeming root for all his hostility. The original is far superior the only thing the remake does better is establishing DeCaprio in the gang before the fireworks start. Basically all the elements that make a Scorsese movie great weren't there; The violence was comic book (especially the number of head shots at the end), the film-making is sub-standard. Only the writing remained consistently good but even then it followed too closely the layout of Internal Affairs which is just plain lazy.\n",

It's such a shame that this didn't lead to bigger and better roles for either of them.<br /><br />Rowe and Cox (and the script, of course) made younger versions of two of the most iconic characters in all of literature credible as teenagers while still more or less staying true to the spirit of the characters in Holmes canon. So often where you get younger versions of established characters, it doesn't work but this is a definite exception. The story is not as strong or as tight as it could have been and occasionally veers a bit too much into Indiana Jones territory (unsurprisingly) for my tastes but, hey, it works in the context of the film which is the main thing. A sequel would have been nice but, alas, it wasn't to be.\n",

            "I was informed that there is an old Eskimo custom where the guest in an Eskimo couple's home has to sleep with the wife as a sign of gratitude for the hospitality. \"Caught\" puts Joe and Betty, a Hispanic couple, in the same situation with the exception that Joe neither knows of or allowed for his guest Nick to show that kind of gratitude for the hospitality offered through his servitude at the couple's fish market and home. If a stray is cute enough, a family member will fall in love with it enough to keep it at home. <br /><br />Joe is much the business traditionalist by his rebuffing of corporate takeover requests pressured on him, but this hurts his marriage, giving his newest and prospective employee a new perspective. He's the son they always wanted to replace the son they wanted to replace, Danny. Betty still gazes at Danny's video past to expect a good future, much as she does for Joe's pastime despite his heart condition. Gazes are what occurs with Nick and Betty that slowly leads to the affair that lifts Betty spirits after Nick coerces Joe into selling the business for a fishing business venture.<br /><br />Sure enough, Danny returns with a wife and child for a surprise visit. The reality of the new living arrangements, Nick in Danny's old room, pushes Danny to the realization of his replacement. Now, a thorn has been added to the side of Nick, Betty, and Joe. It takes a good deed by Nick against Danny as well as the knowledge of Nick's affair that causes Danny to spiral down, even with part of the money Betty gave to help Danny, which is used against her when Joe gets the news broken to him. <br /><br />By the end, all four never see their futures. Half die suddenly while the other half die extremely slowly and sadly.<br /><br />Counting the number of holes in Olmos' face of checking out Alonzo's firm contours and sensuality also helps in viewing this movie but the story is plotted well despite the reality that someone would have beaten the hell out of Danny for his annoying behavior.\n",

You could tell the lead character was not going to get far with baseball for whatever reason, but he was going to do well at something.

            "Antonio Margheriti still is one of my favorite Italian directors (thanks to his 70's & 80's films), but the mix he presents us with \"Alien From The Deep\", he has done before and much better already. \"Killer Fish\" mixes a heist movie while cashing in on Joe Dante's \"Piranha\". With \"Hunters of the Golden Cobra\" he gave us a hero with James Bond allures in a film reminiscent of an Indiana Jones adventure. In a way, \"Aliens From The Deep\" fits in perfectly with all other blends of Margheriti entertainment. It's not on par with the films it borrows from, but it tries to redeem itself by going over the top a little further.<br /><br />So what kind of blend does Margheriti present us this time? Obviously, the Italian title \"Alien Degli Abissi\" (which roughly translates to \"Alien Of The Abyss\") tries to cash in on James Cameron's 1989 hit \"The Abyss\". But that's where the comparison ends. Most of the film can be categorized as some type of 'adventure on a tropical island' film. Some military/governmental facility is dumping toxic waste into the earth. Some noble people try to expose this and ultimately stop them. Some action & some shooting. Fair enough.<br /><br />Now what's with the alien-aspect of this film? Well, we have to wait a good 50 minutes for it to show itself, and it's not really an alien, but some mutant giant monster (basically formed by toxic waste, creating a symbiosis of organic material & scrap metal  I know, that sounds way too smart for a movie of this type) emerging from the bowels of the earth. It somewhat looks like a black giant crab-robot monster of sorts. It just gets thrown into the movie's third act so they could rip off the climax of Cameron's \"Aliens\". Remember Ripley fighting the mother-alien in that yellow robotic worker-unit? Well, it's here too, only it's some type of bulldozer.<br /><br />So \"Alien Degli Abissi\" is just entertaining Margheriti nonsense (featuring yet again fun miniature effects) and nothing more. It's sub-par, as to be expected, but thankfully it's not boring. Oh, and it has Charles Napier running around in it, mainly behind computers. Other than that, he seems to have little else to do.<br /><br />Good Badness? Yes, fair enough fun & inept action/adventure/monster fodder. 4/10 and 6/10.\n",

            "I thought that the newer movies must have recycled all the jokes from old comedies like these and made these movies insignificant. But the charm that is present in this movie isn't present in most of the newer comedies. The plot itself is very good, and the direction sees to it that the movie doesn't get too serious or unfunny. I especially liked the fact that the movie was short.<br /><br />Cary Grant is excellent in his role.His acting is so funny, especially his dialog delivery and his facial expressions. He done't overdo it and fits his role perfectly. In fact, he should have received an Oscar nomination at least for best actor. Then there is a charming actress by the name of Irene who too is cast perfectly. The two share a wonderful chemistry that is one of the best that I have seen in movies. The supporting cast is great, especially the neighbor and the old lady. <br /><br />The direction is great. I especially loved the movie because I was not expecting such a movie in the thirties. It looks much newer, mainly because of the jokes. The ending is great and this movie is too good. 10 out of 10.\n",

Actually, all of the characters are in here, but Mater has more \"screen time.\"<br /><br />The story is a simple one of the other cars trying to teach Mater a lesson. In brief, they give him a taste of what he's been dishing out. The buck-toothed tow-truck has been going around scaring everyone with surprise attacks and they are tired of it. <br /><br />So, one night they all gather in a circle and they tell him a story about the dreaded \"Gas Light\" ghost.

            "I realize this was written, produced, and directed by Robert Altman. (I guessed it when I noticed it was supposed to be taking place in Kansas City, Altman's home town.) But, man, what a lousy movie this is.<br /><br />None of the performers went on to notable careers with the exception of the good protagonist, the nice kid who refuses to join the gang of suburban white delinquents. That would be Tom Laughlin, who had a brief period of celebrity about 40 years ago through the instruments of the Billy Jack movies, confused but well-meaning attempts to illustrate the good life.<br /><br />There's a reason for the careers of these actors, male and female, to have sputtered out. I've seen better performances in high school productions of \"Our Town.\" Hardly a spoken word is believable, and it doesn't help that the characters are shackled to stereotypical roles.<br /><br />The fact that it's so awesomely dated isn't necessarily bad. Artifacts are of their period by necessity. But all the \"warning signs\", of which much is made in the narration, point in the wrong direction. The middle-class white suburban kids all went to community colleges and became X-ray technicians. But in the cities, the baby boomers entered their teens and went ape as they found out that, gee, crime sometimes DOES pay and furthermore it's FUN to outwit or outgun the victims, even if the material rewards themselves were modest.<br /><br />As a sociologist I couldn't help noticing that \"Juvenile Delinquency\" rather suddenly disappeared from college curricula. I suspect that part of the reason was that so much of the data showed a disproportionate number of African-American kids and other minorities were involved, so it became politically incorrect. About the same time, an interpretive position called labeling theory became popular, which I won't describe but which, in essence, allowed us to shift the responsibility from the miscreant to society. Books appeared with titles like \"Blaming the Victim.\" Eldrige Cleaver's career as a rapist became a political act.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the movie. Some movies have a reputation of being so bad that they're fun to watch once in a while. \"Reefer Madness\" is kind of amusing. But other bad movies are just excruciatingly dull. This one joins John Wayne's \"The Conqueror\" in belonging to the latter class.\n",

            "City of Ember is a movie I fear that is destined not to do very well. When I saw it today there was a grand total of five people in my screen, three of which were me and my friends. Neither of my friends had ever heard of the movie, none of my family had a clue what it was about, and the only person that appeared to know anything about it had said the trailer looked a pile of garbage. So I wasn't expecting all that much from the movie, however City of Ember is not by any means a bad movie. In fact it verges on being a very good one, but the ending kicks the audience in the teeth and then makes it just a slightly above average one. The movie works very well for the majority of the film, the cast is extremely strong and the movie is by no means ever dull. Unfortunately the plot is the problem, while it is intriguing, an underground city that reaches the end of its life, unfortunately the writer doesn't seem to go very far with it. The sense of menace is never really there, while the sudden blackouts add a bit of oomph to the movie, apart from that, and a very big mole (don't ask) there never seems a sense of urgency to escaping. Still this is bound to entertain kids, and for once the kid actors don't grate at all, in fact its some of the adult members that I found much more annoying. Anyway its Half Term fodder, and while it isn't Potter or Narnia standards this will entertain kids.<br /><br />So onto the cast. Well the headlining star from all the publicity I have seen, would have to be Bill Murray, despite the fact he isn't in it all that much. Murray actually isn't all that bad here, if I'm honest I expected him to phone in another performance much like he did for Garfield. Instead he does seem to be having a bit of fun, and his character is interesting and develops more towards the end. Still there isn't an awful lot to say about him as he has roughly twenty minutes screen time in total. The main kids are played by Harry Treadway and Saoirise Ronan (from Atonement), both of whom are very good. Treadway is particularly good, while his character is basically the usual stereotype, a boy who feels he is more than what he really is, who wants to make a difference, goes on a grand adventure. He has fantasy lead written all over it, all he needed was to be a farm boy and we might as well have called him Skywalker. Anyway Treadway makes him a very interesting and layered character. He also has considerable chemistry with Ronan, who delivers an equally as impressive performance. Her American accent is pitch perfect, and while she isn't as good as she was in Atonement, she still gets the job done. Tim Robbins shows up in a relatively pointless role as Doon's father. Martin Landau is great as Doon's mentor in the pipeworks, and in my opinion deserves the most praise in the movie. Finally Mackenzie Cook also is pretty damned brilliant, once again putting on an American accent that sounds very legitimate.<br /><br />City of Ember might have a strong cast, but as I have said the storyline is at times questionable. The start of the movie is perfectly fine, we're given a lot of back-story about how Ember came to be, and how a box was passed down from generation of mayor to the next (very well filmed scene). The storyline in fact works perfectly fine until after the kids decide to do something. Once they get their hands on the box and go on their quest not an awful lot seems to happen. In fact the instructions they receive are so damned simple it makes you wonder whether that part really deserves as much screen time as it does? Also everything seems a tad to convenient, one scene towards the end made me roll my eyes in annoyance because I could not believe nobody had turned a certain wheel for over 200 years. The ending as well is god awful. I accept happy endings, I have no problem with them, but the ending here made me want to vomit. Anyway this is nitpicking, mostly the storyline is engrossing, even though the inclusion of the mole is really questionable. The action isn't half bad, although the CGI for a bit in a boat is pretty poor. But the set designs are the real star, not since Del Toro have I seen sets to beautiful.<br /><br />Overall City of Ember is a movie that I did really enjoy, and would happily watch again. But the storyline must be taken with a pinch of salt, and be prepared for an ending that most people will just be a bit dumbstruck by.\n",

In terms of critical comments, yes, you don't really care about the characters, but so what? How often do you really care about the monster fodder in horror films? And true, it wasn't a literal working of the movie, it didn't take place in a mansion and it didn't involve exploring lots of rooms and solving puzzles. That's because it's a movie. A literal translation of Resident Evil would probably be really dull. Games and movies are very different mediums. I don't think some people here understand that. One guy said he thought the movie rocked but after repeated viewings he thought it sucked, and that's a video game player attitude - movies don't have to have good replay value, it's okay to enjoy them once. I only enjoyed Star Wars once, but I don't think it sucked, it just didn't have a lot of depth. Not every movie has to be Citizen Kane. <br /><br />It was an engaging story, moved like lightning and had some excellent scares.\n",

I get the impression that if I was from Mexico or another country that experience the kind of life that was displayed in this movie I would have appreciated it more. I could not understand the emphasize on the title character(Tepepa) as a hero(consistently playing this silly come on let's get behind him music) as he goes about fighting for what I guess is freedom from tyrannical rule. The tyrannical ruler of this movie(played by Orson Welles) is emotionless and just not very impressive as a person but supposedly because he had the money he could rule over everyone. This is what `Tepepa' was fighting against, but by the end of the movie with both Tepepa and the Orson Welles characters killed we're still not sure whether this country will be ruled by the people or by those who have the money. This to me is the problem with revolutions in general(Enough with the social commentary, back to the movie.). Without Welles this would have been a much better movie. He mumbled his way through many scenes and just seemed misplaced in the film. As a story it actually was somewhat interesting, but as a film and production it was lacking.\n",

This is, in my opinion, the best anime ever created. It is an enchanting mixture of drama, comedy, horror, SF and of course, everything is embraced by a wonderful, but heart-breaking love story. The characters are so complex and so powerful, that after a few episodes, you abandon your true persona and start living as they do, start feeling as they do, and their burdens and joys make your heart pulse. Lucy/Nyu is the mainspring of this glorious story, her anger and her strength make her a true goddess, but her feeling and inner burden still classifies her as human. I loved her ever-changing personality, and the outcome of it all. She is accompanied by Nana(who shares a similar secret), Kouta, Yuka and Mayu, and other equally important characters, either masterminds, or puppets, or victims of fate. All these masterfully-created people make this story splendid. As for physical aspects, all the characters are very beautiful, the graphic is excellent, and the color-light effects are well-thought. The music caught my attention from the very beginning, when the opening lighted up the screen. The main theme \"Lilium\" is repeated throughout the series, and this particular song has been blessed with notable importance in the story line. Despite the fact that it is a sublime, gorgeous story, it is also sad, heart-wrecking, and unfair. But in the end, the feeling within is still warm, and the tears that you might shed are both sad and happy. I wish you all a great time viewing this marvel of an anime. O castitatis lilium!\n",

            "I picked up a DVD of this British series from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC and it's fitting that a filmmaker be featured prominently in an art gallery--especially since this film isn't a biography of Chaplin, but a step-by-step analysis of his working style. They did this by collecting outtakes that had been saved by Mutual Studios as well as through photos and even home movies. At first, I thought this all sounded very dry but as the film continued I realized what a great treasure this is. What I liked in particular was how they took two of his earlier non-Keystone comedies and analyzed the many, many changes the film underwent thanks to Chaplin's obsessive-compulsive film style. Considering what a gift he had for making films, this lengthy style of constructing films is forgivable and even understandable.<br /><br />In addition to analyzing his shorts, the documentary also chooses to analyze CITY LIGHTS as well as THE GOLD RUSH and provides many behind the scenes insights. I really liked this, since GOLD RUSH might just be my very favorite silent film (though it's hard to say for sure, considering some of the great films of Lloyd and Keaton).<br /><br />All-in-all, this is an absolute must for serious film students, historians and lovers of silent comedy. Considering all the pain and trouble they went to in making this film, it's no surprise that it earns a 10 of 10.<br /><br />FYI--Fortunately, while this is a nearly perfect film about Chaplin, there are also two wonderful similar documentaries about Harold Lloyd (\"American Masters\", Harold Lloyd: The Third Genius) and Buster Keaton (Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow)--both written by the same two writers who made this wonderful film. See them all if you get a chance!!<br /><br />Also FYI--On the DVD is a 12 minute segment on how they assembled all the footage for the documentaries. It's worth a look to give you insight into this very laborious process.\n",

            "Although completely panned by critics and Visconti fans ever since its release, I happen to think that this is probably Visconti's best film.<br /><br />For starters, I was never a Visconti fan. I always thought of him as a talented window-dresser rather than a great or even a good filmmaker (Bertolucci has inherited his mantle). So I wasn't surprised that he thought he could make a halfway decent film adaptation of Camus' great novel. That he happened to do so was a complete surprise to me.<br /><br />Though dubbed by a French actor, Mastroianni makes a superb Meursault. And Anna Karina was never more beautiful (especially in her first nude scene). The locations are chosen well, though it's often hard to remember that Visconti was trying to stick to the period of the novel (1930s Algiers). There are a handful of other fine performances, and Giuseppe Rotunno uses a palette of colors that is a study in itself.<br /><br />Piero Piccioni summoned up a bleak, modernist musical score that suitably catches the somberness of the material. This film is an unrecognized and almost forgotten example of what an overrated \"auteur\" can do when budget limitations and a combination of good casting and a talented crew come together in a highly serious attempt at adapting a great novel. (And it is far better than Visconti's later prissy adaptation of Mann's \"Death in Venice.\")\n",

            "Short answer: If you love the old Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, do not see this movie. You will be nauseated.<br /><br />Longer answer: In the Dungeons and Dragons community, there is an old joke that the characters \"kill things and take their stuff.\" Well, Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary managed to kill Beowulf and take his stuff. Then they proceeded to kill Hrothgar, the helm of the Shieldings and take his stuff. Then they killed Grendel and took its stuff. Then, they killed Wealtheow and took her stuff. And so on, and so forth. These two imbeciles with Underwoods (an orangutan could have come up with a more sensitive treatment of one of the seminal pieces of English literature!) completely changed the tone of the poem from a serious heroic epic to just another post-modern round of \"no more heroes\" buffoonery.<br /><br />The literary atrocities of Messers Gaiman and Avary upon the source material are as follows: 1. The poem has been dechristianized: On the one hand, it does take out a glaring anachronism (the action of the poem takes place during the Migration Period of the AD 400s-500s, when they would still be following the traditions of the Aesir religion, but the poem was written down in a very Christianized context in England, and the anachronism does add a richness to the language) The only sop to the underpinnings of the source material come in a discussion between two urinating Danes over the relative merits of Christianity and Aesir-worship, and later when Unferth suggests praying to Christ as well as Odin, a suggestion that Hrothgar rejects out of hand (perhaps a reference to the opposite situation in the poem, where the Danes throw off Christianity for a time, hoping that the old gods will smite Grendel where the Christian ones had apparently failed).<br /><br />2. It is implied very heavily that Beowulf was a liar and braggart in his earlier exploits, including the race with Breca: As with many of the other changes, it seems to be part of a deliberate campaign by Gaiman and Avary to strip away the heroic nature of the source material, turning Beowulf into just another trendy 21st-century flawed anti-hero.<br /><br />3. The characters often speak with a much more modern speech pattern (see, for instance, Unferth's first confrontation with Beowulf, where he comes off as much more smarmy than in the poem) that is jarring to the ear and that often seems to lead, yet again, into Gaiman and Avary's unspoken goal of de-heroizing, de-mythologizing, and de-bunking the poem.<br /><br />4. Beowulf does not kill Grendel's Mother: In the poem, it's reported as fact that Beowulf kills her after a ferocious struggle. Nowhere in the poem does it suggest that she seduces him and he lies about killing her. Again, it's the old song of \"everything you know is false -- there are no true heroes.\" 5. Beowulf fighting in the nude: Beowulf does forswear the use of arms in fighting Grendel, but nowhere does it say that he would fight the monster in the all-together, tackle-out (with only strategically-placed objects protecting his modesty). In fighting with Grendel's Mother, it is explicitly stated that he is wearing chain-mail armor and that that saves his life. I'm giving a pass to her appearance, as it's never stated exactly what either she or Grendel actually were supposed to look like.<br /><br />6. Hrothgar is almost explicitly stated to be Grendel's father: No, no, NO! Nowhere in the poem was any mention of Grendel's father made, least of all it being Hrothgar, whom Grendel's Mother would not have been able to have \"known\" anyway, as he was a consecrated king, and it is implied that Cain's kin could not go near signs of rightful royalty. (Cain, the first murderer, who is claimed to be the ancestor of Grendel's kind, not \"Cain,\" the not-appearing-in-the-poem whipping boy of Unferth's, that is.) 7. Hrothgar and Wealtheow have no issue, because Wealtheow will not sleep with Hrothgar due to his sleeping with Grendel's Mother, and the subsequent romantic subtext between her and Beowulf: Wrong again. Leaving behind the fact that Wealtheow probably was not as nubile in the poem as in the movie and showed no romantic interest in Beowulf whatsoever, she and Hrothgar had two sons, and as mentioned before Hrothgar had not slept with Grendel's Mother.<br /><br />8. Hrothgar gives his kingdom over to Beowulf and then commits suicide by jumping off the tower of Heorot: At this point, I walked out of the theater and demanded my money back, as the movie had officially jumped the shark with no hopes of return.<br /><br />In short, the movie was little more than a parody, a lampoon on a great epic.\n",

            "This simple, sensitively handled love story with a WWII background is often bundled together with Mikhail Kalatozov's THE CRANES ARE FLYING (1957) - they were both issued simultaneously on R1 DVD by Criterion and will likewise be issued on R2 by Nouveaux Pictures next January - but actually they are poles apart in terms of stylistic approach. Director Chukhrai shows little of the overpoweringly visual virtuosity of Kalatozov's film (except for the superb sequence near the beginning which earns the main character his heroic status) preferring to capture the reality of the scene rather than its emotional core.<br /><br />Even so, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER is a beautifully made film with winning performances from its youthful leads: a 19-year old boy who wins a much-coveted 6-day leave from the front after blowing up two enemy tanks single-handedly and the suspicious waif he befriends (and subsequently falls in love with) on his clandestine train journey. Events beyond his control contrive to make his visit to his farm-laborer mother a pitifully short one after which, the unidentified narrator tells us, he is once again drafted off to the front to his eventual death (which we never actually see); his misadventures during that train journey and visit to his village take up the bulk of the film as he meets a one-legged soldier coming reluctantly back home to his wife, a greedy train guard who is constantly demanding food from the soldier as a bribe against his telling his superiors that they are stowaways, the duplicitous wife of a comrade of his and his bed-ridden, ever optimistic father, etc.\n",

NOW in films like this down thru time, the screenplay we watch rarely was logical or made much sense. We do not see thrillers for great stories.

Cats, who fly airplanes, cough up spiky hairballs and fight karate. There were dogs who live in doghouses that are filled with computers and satellite hook-ups, that also provide shuttle transportation to \"Control\". I went into this movie expecting Shrek, and came out disappointed.<br /><br />A word of warning-This is NOT a movie for cat lovers. Cats are portrayed as the typical villain, obsessed with world domination. While dogs are made out to be the heroes who not only save the world from allergies but also rescue the humans.

It may be somewhat slow moving at times, and the music is very raw up until the final concert, but that is the beauty of it. This is not a film full of music videos. It is a film documenting how the Beatles produced the \"Let It Be\" album. For anyone interested in the songwriting/recording process, this can be very interesting. The out of tune notes, the messed up lyrics, and the arguments throughout the songs are great because that is how they were really written. Through this video we get to see the skeleton of the album as it is being assembled by the \"Fab Four\". On top of this, there are some amusing parts where they are laughing and goofing around together showing that under the tension and animosity, they were truly great friends.\n",

Unfortunately this movie has not been put on DVD and was not receive wide publicity, so it was overlooked. In addition most of our youth today don't even remember the history beyond last week. I would have liked to see more of the relationship that Teddy had with his men. It's also a fact that many of his Rough Riders did not get to go to Cuba for lack of space on the ships. They wept at the thought of being left behind. At the mustering out - Teddy was presented gifts by his men and he said I'll never forget you. I think these items were overlooked in the movie.\n",

            "I saw this movie at a screening at a local AMC theater - they were at the time considering whether or not to pick up the movie and show it at some places in their chain and randomly invited people to come and see it. I was selected and brought a friend of mine. <br /><br />I didn't have any idea what to expect so went in with an open mind. The premise of the movie was interesting and showed promise, but the characters were all complete clichés and had no depth. I blame the writing of the script because the actors did a decent job with what they were given to work with. The way the story carried out was just slow, slow, slow! All of the conflict felt manufactured and not real. The plot development just didn't work in my opinion. There was just no reason for me to actually care about anyone involved in the movie. <br /><br />The main plot involving the girl and her \"rebelleous side\" could have been lifted out of a bad \"Svaed By The Bell\" episode it was so shallow. The subplot involving the mom and her new boyfriend, for example, felt completely fake and contrived.<br /><br />I feel bad writing such a bad review of this movie but the fact is it just isn't good. I respect the fact that the writer really put a lot into making this movie (she was at the theater and we got to talk to her afterwards) and made it this far, but it just isn't worth seeing. I have seen many independent films that I wish would have been promoted by AMC at arthouses that never made it and they were thinking of giving THIS film a shot at the big time? Give me a break!<br /><br />Check the user ratings - currently 4.5/10. That says it all IMO.<br /><br />* 1/2 out of ****\n",

It just doesn't seem to work as smoothly and perfectly as Trainspotting, altho The Beach isn't *that* bad a flick.<br /><br /> - One thing another poster mentions is the Beautiful People mold that the Beach inhabitants seem to have been mass produced from. While there is a false sense of glamour and youth in the casting of thin/young/beautiful people, maybe that lends itself as a stark contrast to the very dire circumstances and consequences of their actions. These people are attractive and young and hip, yet they are proven to be ultimately silly and frivolous when faced with the reality of their actions.

            "This one is deliciously high concept--What if famed explorers Louis and Clark were plagued with a band of ridiculous, incompetent, bumbling ignoramus rivals? <br /><br />Leslie Edwards (Matthew Perry) is the organizer of the alternate expedition, and seems the brightest of the bunch. At least until you realize that he thinks good choices for his team include Bartholomew Hunt (Chris Farley) as their wilderness-hardened guide with experience and Guy Fontenot (Eugene Levy) as the team's translator. Hunt is basically Farley playing himself, which is both hilariously funny and profoundly tragic at the same time, and Fontenot makes it clear that he doesn't know much about other languages. At first we give Edwards kudos for deselecting him, but when Fontenot lets it be known that he'll only join the expedition if his hot Indian woman (she's not a spouse or girlfriend to him, but property), Shaquinna (Lisa Barbuscia), can also come along, Edwards figures that they probably won't need a translator's services that badly anyway, so brings him on the journey.<br /><br />Levy is great at playing an attractive dunderhead. But we already knew that. That's what he's been doing since his early days on \"Second City TV\" (SCTV) (1976). What's more surprising is that Perry can so effectively come across as a sophisticated halfwit. Perry's performance is so dryly funny that during his scenes it can be easy to mistake Almost Heroes for a much more serious endeavor than the Mel Brooks-styled farce that it is. Farley has no such subtle complexities in his performance, but he's none the worse for that. He just acts natural, aside from feigning idiocy, as an extremely self-indulgent, substance-abusing boor. That may not sound funny, but in the context of the film, it is--Farley was as good at this stuff as was his idol, John Belushi. It's only made tragic by the knowledge that similar behavior off-camera led to his premature death shortly after making this film. The rest of the cast tends to be just as funny, if a bit underused. For that matter, though, even Levy is a bit underused.<br /><br />What brought my score for Almost Heroes down slightly was the fact that it may be a bit too episodic. The episodes are all like very good to excellent skits on \"Saturday Night Live\" (1975) or SCTV, but they didn't necessarily flow together as a film. Taken separately, many of the skits are worthy of a 10--the IMDb message boards are full of threads with viewers citing their favorite moments. Reading through those after watching the film, just thinking about many of them again made me laugh out loud. But as a whole, Almost Heroes seems a bit underdeveloped from what it might have been. This may not be Christopher Guest's best work as a director, but it's worth watching and definitely deserves a DVD release.\n",

            "<br /><br />I saw this film with my daughter (6 years old) and her friend (7), none of whom are Rugrats fans, mostly because they consider the Rugrat's humor to be too immature and inappropriate. My daughter and I did, however, mostly enjoy last year's The Wild Thornberrys Movie.<br /><br />The plot is a literal and figurative shipwreck. The Rugrats and their parents end up on an uninhabited island somewhere in the Pacific, on which the Thornberrys happen to be. Various groups and individuals splinter off in search of others. By the time Nigel Thornberry gets knocked on the head and reverts to the mental age of a 3 year-old, I had lost track of who was looking for whom and why. How a kid is supposed to follow all these machinations is beyond me.<br /><br />The sheer number of characters and the randomness with which they run into each other prevent any sort of character depth from being explored. For example, in The Wild Thornberrys Movie, considerable attention was given to Darwin the monkey, who is one of the more interesting characters in this entire assembly (Darwin is smart and makes very insightful observations of human behavior, but he can only communicate with one person, Eliza - to everyone else, he is a dumb monkey). However, here he has what could be characterized as a cameo appearance at best. So, unless you are already familiar with all the characters, and don't expect much in terms of character development, you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />I think there was a moral to the story (something about leadership and redemption), but I was nodding off by the end of the movie, having lost track of the plot. The audience I saw the film with was mostly subdued, with only a few audible laughs. My daughter and her friend said they liked the movie, but they like every movie I take them to, as long as I buy them popcorn. They did not talk about the movie at all the rest of the weekend. On the way home, we listened to the Lilo & Stitch soundtrack, which has much better songs than the few musical numbers in this movie.<br /><br />I'm not giving this movie the worst rating, because it might be enjoyable for a few Rugrat fans. And the Rugrats' potty humor is not as bad as it could have been, although there are diaper jokes, bird droppings, and Spike the dog raises his leg a few times.\n",

The performances put in by Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai,along with the ethereal music provided by A.R.Rahman and the stunning costumes by Neeta Lulla are going to blow your breath away.<br /><br />No Indian cinema has ever evoked such a strong mixture of emotions in the audience as this one. Each and every frame of the movie is a treat to the eyes. There is richness and grandeur in every aspect of the film.<br /><br />'Jashn-e-bahara' and 'Khwaja mere Khwaja' are superbly shot and executed songs. And then 'Azeem oh Shan Shahenshah' is one song that will remain etched in your memory long after you leave the theater.<br /><br />The scenes where the Emperor Akbar tames the wild elephant and the sword fight between the royal couple are truly memorable.

Like real love, they have their ups and downs, their awkward moments, and their little fights and all those little things that make it a real and believable love and not just a movie love. It's not your typical fantasy life is not really like a chick flick movie. It is a good mix between comedy and the tough stuff. Simon seems to really love Theresa and you can really tell that they are good for each other and compliment each other. I'm kinda a romantic and like the fantasy chick flicks, but this one is probably one of my favorites because the relationships and situations are what love is really about and how it is to want to make that good first impression on your future in-laws. Bernie Mac plays a great dad and reacts like a real father would when meeting his daughter's boyfriend for the first time. One of my favorite lines of his was when Ashton says, \"You knew you were going to kick me out a week ago?\" and Bernie replies, \"Boy, I knew I was going to kick you out 24 years ago when the doctor announced it was a girl.\" That just seems like something a real father would say. So overall, I love this movie and recommend it to anyone. Don't let the chick flick part turn you away, it's more realistic than most. To me, this movie is not mainly about the race issue, or any other issue other than love and the love of two people wanting to spend the rest of their lives together and trying to work their two worlds into one.\n",

This was one of the few Hollywood films of the 1940s to treat mental illness (somewhat) seriously. The director uses sound effects, music and weird camera effects when Crawford's grip on reality starts to loosen. But she slips in and out of madness so quickly that she (and the audience) never knows what's real or not. Crawford is just superb--one of her best performances. Brooks is just great in her film debut. Heflin though, I never liked. He's unattractive and generally cruel--I wondered what Crawford sees in him. And Massey is stone-faced through the proceedings. Still, well worth catching. Love that lake house!<br /><br />The TV print of this is in pretty poor condition. This film needs serious restoration.\n",

However Monica Olivares is fantastic. Whenever she is on screen it lights up, her dialogue is delivered to perfection and her comic timing is immaculate. I have never been so moved by an actress so young (9). When she delivers THOSE lines i can't hold back the tears. It's a shame this is her only movie, i heard she gave up her career because she found Hollywood corrupt and moved to Bristol, England to be a lawyer(!!!).

            "I'm a GIANT fan of the original story by Clive Barker and I think the first two Hellraisers were the greatest horror films ever to be produced. But, ever since Hellraiser 3, untalented directors wear out the name and use the villain-icon Pinhead as a marketing instrument to tell lame and inferior horror stories. Hellseeker ranks as the sixth episode in the series and it is - along with Inferno - the weakest effort so far. The original charm has faded away completely and the tone and atmosphere doesn't come near the morbid and raw originals. The story of Hellseeker has got nothing to do anymore with the original characters Clive Barker created and they might as well could have given this movie a completely new surrounding. Heroine Ashley Laurence is dragged into this film for no particular reason. She doesn't show any resemblance with her original character and even Pinhead himself has gone through a complete metamorphosis. He once was a true symbol of all that represents evil but, after 6 episodes, he merely looks like a lame philosopher who prefers to plea instead of to kill. Hellraiser:Hellseeker is an extremely boring experience with only a few remarkable scenes. And those particular scenes are in fact just a shadow of the ones in the original Hellraisers. It's nothing more than a mediocre attempt to build up a mystery tale. The first hour of this film is a series of hallucinations and illogical dream-sequences. Director Rick Bota constantly tries to fool the audience with plot-twists but, actually, the audience doesn't give a damn! The last 15 minutes of Hellseeker are the only ones worth seeing. Both Kirsty's and Pinhead's screen time are entirely in those minutes and it's the only time the script actually makes a bit sense. If you manage yourself to struggle through the first hour, you'll see a more or less satisfying ending. If the rumors are true, there will be two more sequels coming out in 2004 . Knowing myself a bit, I'll most likely see them...but my expectations have never before been so low!\n",

            "I wouldn't call it awful, but nothing at all shines in this movie, and it is encumbered with some seriously unbelievable basic plot development. It starts out well, but once the main hit is done, it devolves into a long subplot around a young girl which is not compelling, and some action scenes which are theatre of the absurd unrealistic. For example there is a prolonged shootout at the airport in which the lighting is all stroboscopic. No explanation for that. How credible is it that a airport storage area is going to have lights that flash on and off confusingly, and just enough to let Snipes do his incredible escape schtick? This is one of far too few action scenes punctuated by pointlessly drawn out set ups that just fails to draw one into suspending belief.<br /><br />In addition, the whole premise seems to be that the United States CIA team can shoot the place up but get away with it by saying \"national security\" to the Brits. This gimmick relies on a stereotype that is to far afield from reality to be satisfying.<br /><br />There are a lot better action movies out there. Better formulated, better executed. This one is entertaining at times but there is just not enough meat on the bone and after a while it becomes downright boring -- something that should never happen in a good action movie.\n",

            "This is the shortest Chaplin short I have ever watched. As a result, there is absolutely no time for the development of a story--something SUPER-important to good Chaplin films. In addition, this film is almost pure slapstick--with tons of pratfalls, slapping, hitting, etc. Because of this, the film has absolutely no depth or quality about it. It's just people getting hurt with little reason for this other than cheap laughs. So, I would NOT recommend this film to those who are not very familiar with Chaplin's work--they will get the wrong idea about him. They would incorrectly assume he wasn't that funny and his films were quickly slapped together. While this might be true of the very earliest films he made in 1914, by 1915 he was, aside from this film, doing better and more well-crafted work.\n",

            "I've watched a few episodes of Fox's Trading Spouses and I liked some of the episodes a lot. I especially loved the episode that takes a man from Southern America and puts him in a New York city apartment with a very rich New York family. The two families were different, yes, but the Southern man tries to fit in with the new culture and does a very good job. The host family was nice and treated him like a guest. What was nice was the way the host family carried on as normal.<br /><br />Most episodes of Wife Swap are different, however. Like Trading Spouses, the families are completely different, but the problem is that instead of simply having the wife living with a new family the show tries to start a fight by getting each wife to read some sort of manual about the other family and then after a while to set rules. The wives who swap don't even try to adapt to the environment. They are intolerant of other cultures. They loudly and proudly hold on to their way of life, thinking it is superior, and try to change the other people in the process. I hate it most when the wives tell us at the beginning who they are. You don't learn about who someone is by listening to what they say because their ideals about what they should be will get in the way with what they really are. There's a reason why people buy status symbols like large cars and large houses. They are trying to express themselves and project signals to others so they can be recognized as belonging to a certain social identity. Too many families use Wife Swap as a vehicle to show off their identity. Everything the parents do on the show, whether it is sport or shouting at their kids, is just another weak attempt to conform to an image or a stereotype.<br /><br />It's not just the contrived conflict that makes Wife Swap so painful to watch but also the fact that you know the wives are posing for the camera. It is so clear these women are desperately trying to show off their identity for the world to see. In other words, they are acting, and that goes against what I expect in reality TV.\n",

The Director, Nora Ephron, notable for putting out a decent script or two (When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seatle et al), surely must have recognised this scrip for the dog it is. I had to wait for the 2nd 30 minutes or so before I could see a laugh coming and when they did they were mediocre at best. However, my optimism was challenged, because by the time the last 30 minutes of the film came to fruition, it looked as though the cast were just keen to see the end of it and so was I. The writer, Adam Resnick, would have been better off developing the plot into a 5 minute skit for \"Saturday Night Live\", and I am being generous at best here. The end credits should have been all listed as \"Alan Smithee\" for the production crew. It really had me wondering one thing though....

But, of course, they never get right down into the gutter with George Carlin's \"Seven Deadly Words.\" Heavens, say F***, S*** or C***, and you get bleeped, but describe the activity in puerile detail and we can't get enough. Go figure.)<br /><br />But we would all have been better off if the entire movie were bleeped owing to the ridiculous screenplay this film foists upon us. The scenes were so predictable and the stereotypes so obvious that dialog wasn't necessary. Fill in the blanks. Your choice of words would have been every bit as convincing and emotionally uplifting as the nonsense many other reviewers here seem not only to ignore, but enjoy. A fatal flaw for this film as far as I'm concerned. I like Mary Steenburgen, and Lance Henricksen, and most of the rest of the cast were credible, too, given allowances for the mess they had to work with.<br /><br />As for the child molestation business, and the claims of ripoff -- both irrelevant when this banal, derivative film sinks itself in its own morass of cliches.<br /><br />I was led to expect more. I got much less. Go see any number of other films that do so much a better job of putting the outsider among us to reveal our prejudices and fears and irrational reactions to the unknown.

            "The plot of London to Brighton is simple, the budget minimal, the actors and writer/director unknown. But the result is an unexpectedly captivating movie.<br /><br />London to Brighton follows a prostitute and a young run-away as they flee from their recent past: From London to Brighton, no less. Through a well-balanced series of flashbacks, we gradually learn how they came to be running. The movie's tension slowly builds as those who are chasing them draw closer. The premise isn't revolutionary, but the delivery is robust. Half the characters spend half the time not knowing what is happening around them. Like the best thrillers, there is still enough to keep the audience guessing right to the end.<br /><br />The movie is underscored by a very British portrayal of urban mob violence - gritty and selectively brutal, with language to match. The characters are explored just enough to give the movie some depth.<br /><br />The issues contained within the movie are morally challenging. While there is little explicit sexual content, the mere context will be enough to make some viewers uncomfortable. It would be easy to impose \"middle-class\" morality, but fortunately that doesn't happen. Instead the characters react only at the extremes: The prostitute with misgivings about sex involving very young children; not the prostitute with misgivings about prostitution.<br /><br />London to Brighton is notable because it places a 13 year old actor in one of the leading roles. The performance is raw and the look of innocence genuine. Yet she portrays events and emotions that she can have no experience of with disturbing competence. To paraphrase the director, \"she certainly won't be allowed to see the film when it released in the cinema\".<br /><br />The movie is rough round the edges. It drags in places. Sometimes the acting doesn't quite convey all the emotions it could do. It is easy to find fault in the detail. But overall London to Brighton is an impressive first feature by 'Paul Andrew Williams' and most of the cast.\n",

This was followed by a wave of disbelief, a hope that this was a spoof, then the fits of embarrassed laughter took over and I can honestly say that every film-making mistake and cliche that I could think of at the time was being paraded on screen before my very eyes. The acting was non-existent, the lead actor was tragically mannered, wooden, and frighteningly bad. So bad that i could only imagine he was there for the \"Fight sequences\" if you could call them that. They too were cliched, pointless and boring. I'm not even going to comment on the other 1 dimensional jokes of characters that are thrown in there. Every possible stereotype and cliche you could imagine. As soon as you thought that they were all used up, there would be one more you had forgotten about being thrust at you. The directing was woeful, the pace mind numbing, the writing abysmal. I had to wonder how the Director managed to decipher the bar napkins the script must have come off through the obvious state he must have been in to bother to make such drivel. The financiers mustn't have even read anything, and it is a insulting piece of garbage that quite frankly saddens me. To think that there are so many deserving film makers all around the world that struggle to even get the necessary equipment and film stock to make their pictures, and here we see it squandered on what any deranged monkey could see was a piece of rubbish. If i could give it minus stars I would. But for comedy value, or for a lesson on what not to do, it can have it's one star.\n",

            "I went into this movie with a great dead of skepticism. After all, the original was one of the greatest movies ever and trying to recreate that atmosphere, let alone top it, would be all but impossible. However, within the first five minutes I knew that I'd been worrying about nothing.<br /><br />I can understand why some people wouldn't like it, whether they are fans of the original or not, and I think they could have done a better job with some parts of the movie (especially the ending) but it was fast paced, fitfully funny, and most importantly, had great music. There is no way that anyone can deny that this movie pulls together the greatest ensemble of super-star musicians ever seen on film. With such legends as B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Stevie Winwood, and Lou Rawls you can't go wrong. ESPECIALLY when they're in the same band!! Then you have Eretha Franklin and Wilson Pickett to contend with elsewhere in the movie. And that's not to say the Blues Brothers band do a bad job themselves. With a hilariously literal version of Ghost Riders In the Sky and other greats scattered throughout, there's no way that this film can be faulted for its music.<br /><br />Nor for that matter can it be faulted for its stunts, with one pile-up containing the most cars wrecked in a single scene in cinematic history and a classic crash involving a car full of members of the russian mafia, a jar of carpet tacs (or as Elwood amusing corrected, \"dry wall nails\"), a burning strip club, and 50m of a dark Chicago street. Scenes like these only go to prove that Director John Landis has lost none of the excellence he showed in the first blues brothers movie.<br /><br />If you want mega budget demolitions scenes, a dramatic soundtrack, and award winning Oscar nominated acting, then rent titanic. But if you want great R&B music, impossible stunts, and a whole load of great laughs (aided in no small way by the deadpan acting talents of Dan Ackroyd, John Goodman, Joe Morton and newcomer J.Evan Bonifant), then you can't do too much better than Blues Brothers 2000\n",

            "George Bernard Shaw once referred to Puccini's Tosca as that \"shabby little shocker.\" That's an apt description for this Vietnam war film written and directed by James Clavell. Every manner of atrocity is committed in this unredeemable mess: garroting, rape, human boiling, crucifixion, pick-ax murder, and of course point blank shooting. Sure, it's a bloody war, but Clavell goes for the obvious sensational effect, without meaningful human values, much in the same way we've seen more recently in slasher pics.<br /><br />Clavell manages to elicit terrible performances from his usually-commendable team of actors. Patricia Owens as a cynical nurse and Shirley Knight as a sanctimonious nun win the awards for bad acting against fierce competition. And for all the murders he commits, the usually tough Neville Brand is surprisingly innocuous, although it doesn't help that he's forced to play a Vietnamese leader. Greta Chi gives the best performance; doesn't that say it all?<br /><br />There's some consolation at the end of the film when the women take arms against their captors. It's rather cathartic, I have to admit. But for sheer unpleasantness for most of its running time, this is a movie to avoid.\n",

The new kid invites him to his house (in the middle of nowhere) one night and thinks just turn dark and ugly.<br /><br />Seriously WHAT is this about? I have no problem with dark movies but a coherent plot would be nice too! The film is shot in a fragmented style that makes what little plot the film has hard to follow. It SEEMS to be saying something totally negative about being gay and being attracted to the wrong guy--that's all I could get out of it. It ends like a horror movie--a bad one. The acting is (I suppose) good--it's really hard to tell do to the awful dialogue and directing. A sick, disturbing and ultimately pointless short. Skip it.\n",

            "When I saw the very first trailer, I was already sure that this film wasn't going to be one of my all time favorites. I went into the movie with rather low expectations, but still i came out totally disappointed.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not a raging fan of the original books, to be honest I've never read one... I don't even who who the hell this Lemony Snicket is (and after watching this movie, i don't even care)!<br /><br />So, I'm not saying that it is a bad adaptation, I'm saying it is a BAD FILM. <br /><br />Right after the film boosts off, we can hear the gentle voice of Jude Law whining annoyingly about some kids, we don't even know yet. You better get used to this whining, because mostly that is gonna be what you hear during the rest of the movie. Then we finally meet those kids. Two little boys, a bit elder sister, with their mommy and daddy. Mom and dad dies right away, so the kids dig up their relatives all around the world, and ask them, to take care of them children. All of them answer \"Yes! Gladly!\", but the evil Count Olaf kills them one by one, to get his hands on the kids' legacy. Just when this monotonous method gets very tedious, the movie ends, and you can watch some very well made cartoon end credits (surely they wanted to make up for the rest of the movie).<br /><br />What the hell was this all about??? Who the hell were those kids, and why should we, or that Lemony Sicket guy care about them? And who the hell is Lemony Snicket, and why is it necessary for him to whine during the whole movie? Why should I sit through a movie, which has NO ENDING?<br /><br />This movie is a miserable attempt to ride the waves of the adaptation-frenzy.<br /><br />That's it. And the most unfortunate event about this movie, is that it succeeded somehow. I could tolerate all the stupidity, and dumbness in the movie versions of Lord of the Rings, or Harry Potter, but in this case they failed to put together a standalone movie.<br /><br />Even more unfortunate, that some of the staff really tried. Techincally, the film looks marvelous. The costumes, the scenery, the colors, they all come together really well, and we can see the hard work in it (I don't understand though, why a story with basically NO wondrous elements should get a so out-of-this-world scenery). I feel pity for this group of the filmmakers, for having to take part in a mess like this. They deserve better. Better than the director, the writer, and the main actor in this movie. Yes, I'm talking about Jim Carrey.<br /><br />I can't see why most people melts down from the performance he does here. It's hysterical. Count Olaf in Carrey's role is a raging idiot, with no real character, and a stupid fake beard.<br /><br />As far as I know, there's no attempt to make a sequel, so this movie remains a torso forever. A money-monging pile of crap. But if a sequel comes around soon, I'm sure it wouldn't be more either than an attempt to feed some fat producer.\n",

            "The early 1980s saw Britain gripped by a wave of moral panic similar to the hysteria that shook 1950s America concerning the content of EC's horror comics. Only this time, it was a batch of gruesome B-movies from the 1970s that were aggravating the blue-nosed guardians of public decency as well as the government and certain over-zealous members of the police force. These were the days of the 'video nasty', when the likes of Wes Craven's Last House on the Left, Meir Zarchi's I Spit On Your Grave and Sam Raimi's the Evil Dead were available to rent, uncut and uncensored, from your local friendly video library. The tabloid press had a field day, comparing video dealers to drug pushers, whipping up a good old-fashioned frenzy of moral panic among their readers and (naturally) offering blow-by-blow descriptions of the goriest, sleaziest scenes from these oh-so-shocking films in case anyone was left wondering what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />This was the climate into which the 'controversial' (in so far as he ignored politically correct concerns, enjoyed the company of scantily-clad women on his programmes and thought no joke was too tasteless or too obvious to pass up - and often made use of pantomime blood and gore effects that even Monty Python would have balked at) comedian Kenny Everett released his one and only feature film, Bloodbath at the House of Death. Yes, the legendary 'Ev' chose to release a gory, smutty, lip-smackingly excessive horror spoof - just as the genuine articles were being impounded, banned and burned, lest they fall into the hands of impressionable tots. That, along with the ever-cautious British Board of Film Censors' decision to award it an 18 certificate (meaning Everett's fan-base of school-kids and young teens couldn't get into the cinemas to see it), an almost unanimous critical mauling (Kim Newman's excellent reference work, Nightmare Movies, describes Bloodbath as \"excruciating\") and the simple fact that none of Everett's best-known characters (Gizzard Puke, Sid Snot, Cupid Stunt etc) don't get so much as a look-in, meant that Bloodbath was a monumental flop - and Everett's film career was as short-lived as some of the characters herein.<br /><br />The disconcerting thing about Bloodbath is that it doesn't really know what it wants to be. There's none of the fast-paced, joke-a-second, semi-hysterical mayhem that marked the best of Everett's television work, and (surprisingly for a film scripted by Barry Cryer) there are very few actual jokes - indeed, when director Ray Cameron presents the viewer (in the opening moments) with a barrage of shockingly violent murders, shot and staged in a bizarrely straight-faced manner, one has to wonder what on earth is going on. And the remainder of the film doesn't offer a great deal of laughs either.<br /><br />Outside of some amusing set-pieces, like the much-discussed Carrie-inspired decapitation by can-opener, Everett's short-tempered surgeon yanking the innards out of his patient to hurl at his derisive colleagues, the use of John Williams' ominous theme from Jaws (the punchline to this bit is best left to the adventurous viewer) and virtually every moment spent in the company of a deliriously hammy Vincent Price, Bloodbath is a dour and po-faced affair indeed, saddled with rather too much genuine tastelessness (Pamela Stephenson rapidly coming to enjoy being raped by a poltergeist, for example) and the most feeble of finales to make much of an impact. The plot - what there is of it - is simply forgotten halfway, and Everett isn't given nearly enough screen time, which is a real shame given the talent for (admittedly broad) characterisation his best television work displayed.<br /><br />For the record, the executive producer Laurence Myers was also responsible for the nerve-shreddingly awful Gary Glitter vehicle 'Remember Me This Way', the low-budget glam-rock ragbag 'Never Too Young To Rock' and the oddly entertaining seventies time capsule 'Side By Side'. Not exactly an impressive track record, but at least he was well used to backing losers by the time Bloodbath came out.\n",

I obviously wasn't expecting this National Lampoon film to be anywhere near as good as Van Wilder (really funny movie--a must see) or even Dorm Daze (which was okay, not extremely great), but this one was just pathetic. The storyline (girl chooses to stay a virgin but her boyfriend isn't keen on that idea) seems like it would be interesting, but without some comedy it was made out to be just plain awful and perhaps too realistic. The characters were the typical college kids; nothing too extravagant. I must say that my favourite thing about the whole movie was the choice of music played-that's all! Boring, pointless and not at all comical pretty much sums up this lackluster film.

I was really excited when I saw a promo pic and a trailer for it but I was utterly disappointed when I finally confronted the real thing. Words fail me in terms trying to find a level of garbage this movie has reached. The special effects are amazing, I will give credit where it's due. However, like so many other fanfilms, this movie is made just so the special effects team behind it could show off and likely that someone wanted to look cool with a lightsaber. I have been watching the Star Wars movies religiously ever since I was a youngling and I know when someone does credit to the Star Wars Universe (Even if Episodes I and II didn't, lol) and this movie does not. I would advise anyone even thinking of watching this movie to stay away and save yourself the time wasted on this mockery of that which we, the fans, hold so dear to our hearts. Please, if you are a die-hard Star Wars fan and truly love the saga, then I would say don't waste your time. The story is cheap and artificial. The acting is atrocious and the dialogue is even worse.

Maybe it's because \"Explorers\" only sports three main characters, and \"The Goonies\" has seven (plus Sloth) ... but I'd hold this movie up with that one any day.<br /><br />The humor comes from strange places, and truly lands in bizarro world during the last act, but it captured my imagination seamlessly when I first saw it at the age of eleven. I'm older now, so maybe it's just nostalgia, but if you're into the whole 1980's retro thing, this belongs in your collection with the rest of the Disney-ish buddy movies.

            "A small, uplifting film that has a surprisingly full body. Very strong performances by Tom Berenger and Barbara Hershey. They just seem to fit together naturally. I suppose that their naturalness on-screen in this film can be credited largely to their considerable talents. But, bless whoever cast them together for seeing their possibilities.<br /><br />The film's premise was very engaging. The action was well paced. Most of the characters actions and reactions rang true. There was some good humor, particularly regarding the dog.<br /><br />The dab of history laid out in the storyline was tantalizing. I suspect that there is some grain of truth to Lillian's recounting of pertinent historical events.<br /><br />I think that Wilford Brimley contributed greatly to the success of the story. Having his narration start things off was a stoke of genius. He brings such gravitas and authenticity to everything he does that the viewer encounters absolutely no difficulty suspending disbelief as necessary to embrace fully the storyline.<br /><br />The locations were fantastic and the cinematography was inspiring. After first seeing the theatrical release, I rushed home and scoured my trusty atlas to locate the Oxbow Quadrangle in northwestern Montana. I just knew that it was a place that I would love to explore someday with my kids. When that search proved fruitless, I went online to the State of Montana's website, only to be frustrated once again. It was not until the movie first hit TV (HBO, I think) that I endured the credits to learn that it had been filmed in Alberta, Canada and Mexico.<br /><br />I also loved the theme music.<br /><br />I have seen this film about 15 times in the past 10 years.

            "I had a dim memory of a movie I saw while very young in the 1970s about a computer called Colossus that tries to take over the world. I remembered only a few things about it: that it was out of human control, that it executes people, that it speaks through a very creepy spherical metallic speaker with a pre-Cylon computer voice, and that the movie SCARED THE HECK OUT OF ME.<br /><br />So I recently buy the DVD, half expecting to be let down by my adult, cynical eyes. Fortunately, all the above-mentioned items are just as I remember them, and better, the rest of the film is well-done. The technical aspects of the story are questionable, as with all evil computer stories (ever hear of using wire-cutters, people?), but after reflection, not as questionable as I thought.<br /><br />The setup for the story is a new supercomputer created by one Dr. Forbin (Braeder) which is placed in complete control of the U.S. defenses, including nuclear missiles and anti-ballistic missile defenses. The computer soon detects that the Soviet Union has a similar machine and wants to connect with it. Forbin talks the president into allowing it, and things spiral out for control from there very quickly.<br /><br />Bu the best part of the movie is the moral of the story. Dr. Forbin, after activating his new computer, attends party at the White House and publicly states his wish that not only will his machine prevent war, but that it will also herald a new age of human advancement, in which famine and disease and pollution and overpopulation will be eliminated with the help of Colossus' vast computer power. Later in the film, Colossus offers EXACTLY these very things, much to Forbin's bitter disappointment.<br /><br />How many tyrants attain power promising these very things? \"Give me unlimited power, and I will build a Utopian future! Along the way, many people may have to die, and you will lose your freedom, but in the end I will set it all to rights.\" The difference is that Colossus may very well be able to deliver on its promises, and this actually makes it MORE frightening than any bumbling human dictator. Human tyrants are driven by flawed ideology, thieves' greed, or psychotic motives, and they are guaranteed to die after a few decades, like any human. But Colossus' menace is its cold logic, lack of ideology, and it's ability to learn and survive almost without limit.<br /><br />Forbin, in his struggle to contain his creation, is joined by his fellow scientists, including the beautiful Dr. Markham (Susan Clark), a professional scientist. She adds immensely to the human side of this story.<br /><br />The film is timeless. The look of the 1970s technology may be dated, but it's appropriate for the Cold War era this film is a child of. If you are a sci-fi fan who likes to think instead of watching brain-numbing action, this film is definitely worth a look.\n",

Besides them showing how she died and her getting revenge on the people that hurt her, by killing their kids, nothing else has to do with the story of Bloody Mary. The majority of the movie is people being killed one right after the other. They needed to go into more depth about Mary. Also instead of them saying Bloody Mary in a well lighted room, they should have done it in the bathroom with the lights turned off and facing the mirror, the way it's suppose to go. I have heard many versions of the story, but I'm pretty sure she was suppose to be pregnant....<br /><br />OK so at the end we find out that Billy was the kids stepfather, wow big surprise, who killed Mary by accident. So he goes and tries to kill the brother and sister. We see the brother die, but at the end the sister doesn't even look sad. I have heard that they cut out the part when they run into each other at the hospital. Why would they do that? It kind of makes the ending look stupid.<br /><br />Anyways it's kind of cool the way that the people die but nothing's a mystery. You know what's going to happen before it happens.

            "Elliott Gould is bemused and colorful as a Vietnam veteran back in college, stuck between a rock and a hard place; he's working semi-seriously towards getting his teaching credentials, and yet is stymied by his fellow classmates who want to protest the hypocrisies of the Establishment (with Gould's help), and also by his instructors, hypocrites with power who work by a double standard. Director Richard Rush occasionally does fluid work here, and the film has fervently funny and thoughtful scenes, however Robert Kaufman's hot-headed script, adapted from Ken Kolb's novel, is awash with half-realized ideas. The kids sound off violently against the University's directors, but we're never made aware of what they want--or what they want done about their concerns. Made during an era wherein young people hoped to change the world--and get laid--the characters in this picture nevertheless are just sounding-boards for the writer. Topics are brought up not to be discussed but to be challenged (and, in these cases, the kids are just as blind as their professional elders). Was that Kaufman's point, that student riots really ARE just violent preludes to sex and otherwise a waste of time? Gould's shaggy character rants and raves too, but his Harry Bailey presents a different problem: he cheats, he lies, he cuts corners, he heartily embraces his own set of values and yet is happily corrupt! A hypocrite himself, Bailey loves teaching, loves kids and their innocence, but he doesn't see his own short-comings--and I'm not sure the filmmakers do, either. Bailey is a one-sided writer's creation (and oddly, for a movie filled with so many liberal stances, Bailey--like most of the other characters--is anti-female and homophobic). Candice Bergen (in a wan performance) plays Gould's shiksa goddess girlfriend who doesn't like being called a WASP and who would give up everything to be married in the suburbs. She's continually put down for that, as if she's a sell-out, and yet how exactly would Gould live if he were to achieve his dream of being a high school teacher? As it is, he can't even pay the rent on his apartment! The riot sequences are staged for utter seriousness--and they are filmed and edited with precision--but they don't come organically out of this story, they are interjected for shock value. The rage and anger presented here is convincing, but the cause is confusing. These students don't seem to want peace at all, and neither does director Rush. The narrative is pushed towards violence for no other purpose except to vividly stage two movie riots. This is exploitation, and the crummy feeling one gets from the picture can be related right back to the people behind it: they're hypocrites, too. *1/2 from ****\n",

            "\"Hey!\" Chow Yun Fat says, covering a baby's eyes. \"X-Rated action!\" He's not wrong: Hard Boiled is a film clearly not afraid to embrace its genre's excesses. While most modern action films (Smokin' Aces for one) aspire to some sort of grand intelligence while providing shoot-outs and explosions, this film is a reminder of times when action films suffered no such pretensions. <br /><br />Crowds of people are gunned down without explanation and the smallest things explode for little or no reason. The bad guys are massively exaggerated cutthroat caricatures and the good guys never miss. Scenes of Fat and Leung running down corridors are inexplicably shot in slow motion. And, for all of these reasons, it is amazing. It's fast, it's exciting, and it never lets up.<br /><br />Hard Boiled is loud, exciting, and, thanks to quite terrible dubbing and a ludicrous early 90's soundtrack, often unintentionally hilarious. It is a film that places entertainment firmly ahead of plausibility and logic, and is quite frankly awesome for it.\n",

            "CHARLOTTE SOMETIMES tells the story of Michael (Michael Idemoto), an automobile mechanic that rents part of his converted house to Lori (Eugenia Yuan) and her lover Justin (Matt Westmore). Lori and Justin's relationship is based almost entirely on sex, so after their frequent coital encounters, Lori finds herself knocking on Michael's door in search of emotional intimacy. Lori and Michael talk, watch videos and basically just hang out together. They are friends, but clearly Michael is in love with her.<br /><br />So Michael doesn't have to hear the sounds of Lori and Justin's love making, he often escapes to a local bar for a drink or two. One day, Lori asks Michael if she can fix him up on a date. He declines.<br /><br />On a subsequent visit to the bar, Michael meets Darcy (Jacqueline Kim). Intrigued by her, Michael begins to spend time with her. Although Darcy's clearly interested and Michael's attracted to her, he decides to wait for them to have sex. This is true despite that fact that Darcy tells him that she is going out of town.<br /><br />While Darcy's away, Michael examines his feelings toward her and learns more about her in the process. We also discover that things aren't quite what they seem.<br /><br />In Eric Byler's film, which he wrote (based on a story by Byler and Jeff Liu) and directed, the basic situations are set up very nicely. There isn't the compulsion like some new filmmakers to explain every detail. On the other hand, some of the dialog is obvious, especially when it comes to Michael's expression of his feelings toward Darcy. However, given the nature of Michael's character, that's not a significant shortcoming of the script. A major logic problem that develops at the end is a problem. It causes unnecessary confusion in the final act of the film.<br /><br />In terms of character, Michael is much too passive. Rather than show some initiative, he waits for others to take action before he does anything. Simply put, there is no fight in him. As a result, it's hard to connect with Michael on an emotional level. This is really a shame, because being in love with a woman that only wants to be your friend is a situation in which most men can relate.<br /><br />That aside, the other main characters are pretty much on point. Justin is a self-absorbed ladies man that is unwilling to share himself emotionally. Lori is the pretty and sweet girl that always feels unsatisfied in relationships because she's always attracted to emotionally unavailable men. There's something very different going on with Darcy, but you'll have to see the film to find out.<br /><br />Overall, CHARLOTTE SOMETIMES presents a very worthwhile scenario, but doesn't live up to its potential. For those looking for an intelligent film that presents its characters in interesting ways, it is definitely worth a look. It features an attractive cast with generally strong, believable performances. I just wish Michael's character had a little more fire in him.<br /><br />The film is nominated for two Independent Spirit Awards. One is for the \"John Cassavetes Award\" for best feature made for under $500,000. The other is for \"Best Supporting Female\" recognizing Jacqueline Kim's fine performance as Darcy.<br /><br />While not a great film, CHARLOTTE SOMETIMES is better than a lot of what Hollywood has to offer. It's also an apportunity for audiences to see some fresh young talent in a film with something on it's mind\n",

            "I was pleasantly surprised by this flick. I expected another low-budget bad zombie movie, and what I got was a very good low-budget zombie movie. Once I got past the very cheap zombie makeup, I enjoyed the humor and the frequent nods to the zombie horror genre. Much of the humor in this film will probably play better to people who've lived in the South, but I think it has appeal for many genre fans.<br /><br />\"Hide and Creep\" is a nice change from the usual crop of poor straight-to-video horror films that have been coming out of the South over the past few years. Unlike some of the terrible works by rather talentless directors such as Jeff Thomas, et al., Hartsell and Shirley's film isn't heavy-handed and full of religious agenda (see \"13 Seconds\" if you'd like to see what I'm talking about). Despite what was clearly a non-existent budget, the directors here did keep production values in mind to the extent they could afford them. I'd really like to see what they could do with a real budget and hopefully they've gotten one by now because these folks have a shot at doing something great in horror if they're given the chance.<br /><br />Considering that this was Hartsell & Shirley's first film, it's an excellent effort from two people who are obviously fellow horror fans. I hope to see more from them!\n",

With a cast of three - outer-space technocrat Kirk Douglas, wife Farrah Fawcett, and prim British agent Harvey Keitel. Read those names again. The movie opens with some peculiar choreographed stuff that looks like a tribute to the moon landing at the Oscars, and proceeds before long to an absurdly jocular Douglas-Fawcett shower scene. There as elsewhere, Douglas looks like he's having the time of his life - huh huh, I'm in the shower with Farrah Fawcett - only they're being MENACED BY KILLER ROBOTS for Christ's sake, and there he is winking at us. Farrah's blank 'oh my gosh' stares make for a dissonant counterpoint, her star must have been fading around now because we get some gratuitous boob shots. And meanwhile there's Harvey acting as weird as ever while he frantically builds/turns into a robot. There was some kind of money in this movie, clearly, and some of the flashing lights and stuff amount to a dream date for stoners, but it's still an 80s sci-fi epic from the director etc.\n",

            "In Kansas City, the criminals Peter Harris (Jack Elam), Boyd Kane (Neville Brand) and Tony Romano (Lee Van Cleef) are individually hired by a stranger (Preston Foster) that plots the robbery of an armored car after receiving the money from a bank in the next door of a flower shop. However, each one of them wears masks and does not know the identities of the others; therefore they can not recognize each other. They succeed in the heist of 1.2 million dollars and escape in a van of the Western Florists, and the mentor of the robbery gives tickets to them to travel abroad, promising to share the money later. Meanwhile the decorated soldier and ex-con driver of the Western Florists van Joe Rolfe (John Payne) that is delivering flowers in the shop is framed. He is accused of participating of the heist, arrested and tortured by the police, loses his job, and when the police recognizes the mistake, he is released. Unemployed, he discovers that Peter Harris went to Tijuana, and he decides to chase the criminal and request one fifth of the amount.<br /><br />\"Kansas City Confidential\" is a great film-noir, with a good story and development of the characters. John Payne has an excellent performance in the role of a former war hero that tries to have a straight life after some gambling problems, but is framed, loses his job and the rest of his honor and sees his picture in the front page of the news, becoming impossible to find a new job. This injustice triggers his search for the real criminals, not seeking for justice, but a share of the money. The characters, with the exception of the sweet Helen Foster, have some sort of amoral behavior, as usual in this genre. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"Os 4 Desconhecidos\" (\"The 4 Unknown\")\n",

            "Unfortunately I have to acknowledge that this movie is horrible. I believe that everyone who ever read the Book will agree that whoever tries to make a movie based on this Book must be of equal talent as writer himself. In this case Bortko who not only directed but also wrote the script is not up to the task. He simply took all (almost all) dialogs from the Book and incorporated them into the script except as everyone already mentioned by adding new character played by Gaft, which is not even natural to the Book. I do sincerely believe that screenwriter and/or director have all rights to adapt book to the screen and there is no way that book can be made into adaptation as simple illustration and regarded as Art. And this is the case in this adaptation, it is mere illustration and is made for people who don't have time to read or simply don't want to read. For those folks this mini series is a heaven. It gave them to hear almost word for word all dialogs from the Book but leaves real philosophical ideas Book raises behind. It is made in bad Hollywood traditions as we can find a lot of really good adaptations made there, more over Russia has reach tradition in movie adaptations especially big philosophical novels such as 'Hamlet' and 'King Lear' by Kozintsev or 'Brothers Karamazov' by Pyryev. There not even single artist up to the task to play characters from the Book, except Abdulov. I also would like to add couple of more things. First is that original music is so resembles music by Carl Orff 'Carmina Burana' it is striking to the heart. It is better if Bortko used it instead of music by Kornelyuk. Second, everyone already mentioned that special effects are lowest points of the movie but how come there are so many talented programmers in Russia and none of them could be invited to make computerized special effects? And the last but now least, incursions made by director by using old black and white newsreels are not providing any good to show up Moscow of the 1930th.\n",

            "I didn't have much faith in this movie when I bought the dvd, but it was cheap and I figured it had to contain at least a couple of scares. After the first few minutes I thought I was wrong, this movie was going to suck but as it progressed it did get better.<br /><br />The wrap around story is easily the worst of the bunch, the acting and production is amateurish at times. While it does contain some humor David Johansens hammy acting takes away any suspense that could possibly be being produced. The whole plot of the wrap around story is pretty flimsy as well and seems very forced, as if the producers just needed to get the film to the point where the stories are told. The resolution that comes at the end is just as forced and is pretty pathetic.<br /><br />The first story, about a group of jocks picking on a school handyman, doesn't fair much better in it's acting or production values. Once it gets going there is a level of creepiness to it but the whole set up before the climax is so poorly done that you find yourself caring very little about what happens.<br /><br />Aside from some poor special effects (well good in a high school class project sort of way) the second story involving three troublemakers looking to profit from the murder of a native man, fails to really grab the viewer. There isn't much wrong with the story it just doesn't do much until the twist ending. At that point everything registers and the story makes sense, unfortunately it's not much fun getting to that point.<br /><br />The final, and best, story is a nice little \"who-done-it\". While the story, of four friends getting together for a night of \"passion\" which ends in murder, doesn't really set itself up as well as it could, it does contain the most suspense of the 4 stories. This entry contains the best of everything in the movie, best story, acting and suspense. The topper is that is also contains the best ending as you continue to guess who the culpret is. <br /><br />I could almost recommend this movie if it had a better wrap around story to hold the rest of the movie together. Also, if you want a professional type horror movie it is best to stay clear of Campfire Stories. I realize I'm probably going very easy on this film but I did like it much more then I thought I would, it's a guilty pleasure that's worth 90 minutes of mindless enjoyment if you can find it for the right (read VERY LOW) price. Mind you, I would recommend 1997's Campfire Tales over this film any day. Campfire Stories rates a 4 out of 10.\n",

            "The Mandarin Mystery is what happens when you take a fairly standard locked room mystery, add a little too much romance, and season the mix with an ample supply of humor. Eddie Quillian brings a lot to the role and really makes it his own, despite the fact that his take on Queen is somewhat different from the usual character we are so used to seeing. Quillian's just as bright, not as serious, and apparently has the libido of a teenage boy.<br /><br />Queen spends as much time pursuing the lovely victim of a theft which appears connected to the murder (Charlotte Temple) as he does the murderer and thieves, and a long deductive chain is compressed into a pithy film with an economical script. The acting talent is somewhat uneven. Ms Temple gives a sub-par performance, Quillian is excellent, and Wade Boteler as the senior inspector Queen does well doubling as Ellery's straight man and a gruff old no-nonsense cop.<br /><br />Although made in 1936, The Mandarin Mystery's story, pace, camera work, themes, and sets have the feel of a late 1950s TV mystery show.<br /><br />Because of the way the original novel was adapted, the logic of the deduction which leads to the resolution of the case is not as clearly spelled out as it could have been. Nevertheless, the film will interest mystery fans who enjoy the hardcore analytical aspects of detective work as depicted in traditional mystery novels (Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle fans for example), and, of course, Ellery Queen aficionados.\n",

            "Brigitte (Emily Perkins) is alone, after killing her sister Ginger (Katharine Isabelle), and injecting a substance called monkshood to delay the process of transformation in a werewolf. She has an overdose and is sent to a rehabilitation clinic, where she is mistakenly taken as a drug addicted. Meanwhile, a beast is chasing her, trying to become mated with her. Ginger escapes from the clinic with Ghost (Tatiana Maslany), a needy and lonely girl that wants to be friend of Brigitte. \"Ginger Snaps: Unleashed\" is a great sequel of \"Ginger Snaps\". The participation of Katharine Isabelle is minimum and basically is limited to give her name to the credits. However, Emily Perkins has another excellent performance in the dramatic role of a young woman fighting against her fate. This sequel is very claustrophobic and also very violent, but it deserved a better conclusion. The story is better than the first one, but I was a little disappointed with the end. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"Possuída 2\" (\"Possessed 2\")\n",

Later, I watched it with my Mom and she told me she knew some of the people involved. The things that William Bradley did were awful, but it is a true story and people are sometimes evil, without a reason for it.

            "Lonely teenagers Wyatt (Mitchell-Smith) and Gary (Hall) decide to make a woman that fits all their requirements from a computer, only to find not everything fits perfectly.<br /><br />There were two words that attracted me to this high school comedy, John and Hughes. The mastermind behind the conceptual excellence of skiving school to live in Ferris Bueller's day off to the film that showcased how teenagers really felt about their suffocating parents in the Breakfast club, the man seemed to have his knowledge spot on regarding teenage life.<br /><br />What emerges is a pretty standard and very degrading depiction of lonely lust, containing two teenagers who are the good guys, but are hard pushed to maintain that.<br /><br />Anthony Michael Hall, a hero from the Breakfast Club, feels repetitive and loud in another role for Hughes. Mitchell-Smith likewise feels weak and a stereotype of high school repression and against Hall, we have the most conventional and boring comedy duo ever mastered, which is a great shame for a director and writer who also created some of the best teenage comedy ever.<br /><br />The premise for the story sounds promising, two lads attempt to break science through some technological mastery in an attempt to fulfil their lust on a weekend away from their parents.<br /><br />So after some degrading and embarrassing perversion by the lead duo on cheerleaders and a head turner away from dropped pants do the duo retreat to their sanctuary and form an hyperbole of illogical science to fulfil their uses and gratifications. Through some fast flowing wires and a bemused science guard to the pair get their just deserts.<br /><br />One thing John Hughes usually does perfectly is introductions and Kelly LeBrock's opening shot is the equivalent of Megan Fox in Transformers, a slow panning from her legs upwards in a small Barbie styled costume, a beautiful introduction which is maintained through the nest few scenes as she jumps into the shower with the two lads, uses provocative gestures such as late drinking and kissing practice to keep any horny male teenager hooked.<br /><br />Certainly LeBrock hits the nail on the head, acting flirtatious and forward to justify her character as perfect female, until the inevitable outcome the plot always has in mind, there is more to a person than looks tag.<br /><br />Through some careful shots and repetitive music we see the story pan out as any other romantic comedy would and there are minimal surprises to generate a good watch, particularly when the humour is gross out and shamefully degrading to the actors.<br /><br />The final nail in the coffin is the change in personalities of the final act and as predictable as the coming of next year will have you shaking your head.<br /><br />Certainly not too much consequence came from this film as there were Ferris Bueller's amongst others to follow and create a reputation of teenage comedy mastery.\n",

            "For the average viewer, this movie will no doubt be very confusing and a bit silly. However, for those who adore Bergman films, it will be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Although I have seen quite a few Bergman films, I am not a huge fan. While I can appreciate many of his films, sometimes I feel he is just too depressing or angst-ridden to watch. This film, in fact, might just be my least favorite film he did--it's a close call between this film and Persona.<br /><br />Hour of the wolf is a very surreal film and I think it was deliberately made to be very confusing as to exactly what was occurring--was Max Von Sydow's character a schizophrenic or were there demons or monsters on this island==it's very hard to tell. Frankly, I found myself not really caring.<br /><br />In addition to MANY confusing story elements, you do get to see an old lady pull off her face and put an eye into a glass of water. This isn't really as gross as it sounds. Also, a man walking up a wall and standing on the ceiling and another guy sprout gigantic wings. All this is reminiscent of a painting by Bosch or Dali.\n",

            "There are very few horror movies that even slightly frighten me, and this is probably true for most grown-ups. The monsters in those films are caricatures, blatantly cartoon-ish villains that are one dimensional and, as mature people know, don't really exist. That's because most of the truly frightening monsters in real life wear clothes just like the rest of us, have normal jobs just like the rest of us and are often living right next door, usually appearing to be ordinary family men and women on the surface. They will wave at you or nod as you pass them, if that's the custom in your area, or perhaps they will just stroll quietly by you and you will never know the horrors they commit. Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killing cannibal, might have not gotten caught when he did if it weren't for that horrific stench of decaying corpses that permeated from his apartment; because on the surface he looked and acted just like a quiet, ordinary guy. And what scares us most of all, if we admit it or not, is not only how ordinary he seemed but that at one time he was just like us, he just started down a twisted, psychotic path somewhere along the way, a path any of us could have fallen into had we been in similar circumstances. The real monsters are in all of us. Fortunately, most of them are completely inactive which gives us, on the surface, most of the time, a fairly placid and uneventful life.<br /><br />Then you watch Spoorloos. It works so extraordinarily well because it feels like a documentary, a slice of life of the three main characters, Rex, Saskia and Raymond. Rex's girlfriend Saskia, just mysteriously vanishes and, being a realistic film, you see the horror, loss and near insane obsession such a loss would bring. You witness his wrenching emotions, excruciating emptiness and desperation in trying to discover someway, anyway to find her. And then you meet Raymond, the man who looks like an ordinary man with a seemingly happy family and, for no apparent reason, you realize he is responsible for Saskia disappearing from Rex's life. But what did he do with her? Surely this man, this seemingly ordinary man, could not have done anything terrible could he? What follows is the unfolding of a mystery that moves so painfully and methodically, developing into such a real horror story that you find yourself stunned when the credits roll. And what really is scariest of all, the character that sticks with you the most, is the monster. George Sluizer, the director, carefully leads you through the story from every character's perspective but the one whose eyes you see through the most, is the monster. You are left wondering \"how could he?\" \"could I ever do something like that?\" Like life, it does not have a neat, tidy happy ending but rather leaves you with too many disturbing questions of an extremely disturbing story. This is movie making and story telling at its best. Not in terms of incredible special effects or beautiful cinematography but understated, realistic acting of realistic characters and story. Spoorloos, along with Roman Polanski's \"Repulsion\" are the two most frightening movies I have seen for they have haunted me the most, due to their unflinching, realistic, disturbing stories.<br /><br />As a footnote, the director, George Sluizer, was paid a pile of money to direct a pile of crap, an American version of this story, the English title was also \"The Vanishing\" but this turd was made five years later (1993). Do yourself a great favor and do not confuse the two if you are renting, look for the Dutch/French version made in 1988. Also, if you run into the real monster from Spoorloos, or someone just like him, send him to meet Todd Graff, who wrote the Hollywood version and all the others responsible for that awful mess.\n",

            "I am a seventeen year old teenage girl; basically, the entire demographic that this movie was going for. Having seen \"A Walk to Remember,\" I figured it'd be another Mandy Moore chick flick - not bad, but nothing special.<br /><br />This movie just *didn't work.* Using two different teen novels as a basis for a \"plot\" didn't work. The plot was all over the place; my friend (also a seventeen year old female) and I would stare at the screen and whisper, \"What the hell was that?\" every five minutes. This movie had every cliche imaginable: teenage pregnancy, divorce, marriage, birth, death, car accident. If reading that seemed random, try watching it. It's ridiculous. Oh, and I neglected to mention the pot smoking grandmother.<br /><br />Here are a few examples about what just didn't work in this movie:<br /><br />About 10-15 minutes into the film, a boy collapses on the soccer field. He's clutching his stomach, and my friend and I both immediately thought, \"Oh, appendicitis.\" Next shot (this is after he passes out and people are surrounding him), he's on the ground clutching his chest. Dramatic voice-over is something along the lines of him dying of a heart defect.<br /><br />Insert my friend and I (and other audience members) saying, \"What the hell?\"<br /><br />Another scene. The best friend is pregnant. She and Halley (Mandy Moore) are talking afterwards, and Scarlett (the friend) is wearing a tank top with four pictures of the GERBER BABY. \"What the hell?!\"<br /><br />It goes on and on. Honestly, if we'd realized 20 minutes into it how disorganized and poorly put together it was going to be, we would've left. The only reason we stuck around the whole time was because we'd sat through it for so long that we couldn't get our $9.25 back if we left.<br /><br />As far as the acting goes, Mandy Moore was decent, but I didn't really get her character. As I haven't read the two novels this movie was based on, I don't even know if she was playing two different characters or one. Actually, when Halley would do a total 180 between scenes, my friend and I joked whether they pulled the scene from novel one or novel two. As for Trent Ford...I'm not going to discuss his looks other than in this statement, because I don't think criticizing an actors appearance does any good. As far as the actual acting went...It was pretty rough. Didn't do anything for me. A couple of the supporting characters (played by Allison Janney and Alexandra Holden) were ok; others (Mackenzie Astin, Mary Catherine Garrison) were as terrible as Trent Ford.<br /><br />One can only hope that if Mandy Moore wishes to be taken seriously as an actress, she'll accept a better script next time, because she's not a terrible actress.<br /><br />I gave it 3/10, and that's only for the non-comedy induced laughs my friend and I, as well as several other members of the very small audience, had.\n",

Kudos even to stiff-board Brolin for adding believability to his dumb runaway father character. Brooke Adams is believable as the low income mom trying to cope with her daughters' problems. Ione Skye puts a whole different view on the \"easy girl\" we remember for high school. And Fairuza Bulk puts a nice believable twist on her role as narrator learning about real love.\n",

            "I am like the other reviewer who saw the poster of this in a theater, oddly enough I think I was there to see Batman Returns. The poster was a picture of his shield and I said that might be cool, but alas this movie would never make it to the big screen. The problem is they apparently ran out of money after the first scene. Captain America goes after the Red Skull beating up Nazi soldiers then totally gets beaten up by the skull that doesn't look like a skull, but it is still creepy. Cap gets tied to a rocket which is launched at the White House then he diverts it to Alaska. After this the budget runs out and the middle is just the guy without his costume running around in modern America. The skull is still around and he now looks like a guy with a bad sunburn and he is trying to kidnap the Pres. There is a little action at the end, but it is not as good as the promising beginning. Cap does get to beat up the skull at the end too, but the guy has to be pretty old at this point so it isn't really a fair fight. <br /><br />The costume is pretty good and the guy looks like Captain America, but he is kinda whiney. This film isn't very good, but a worse Marvel movie is The Punisher, they couldn't even get the costume right in that one.\n",

They're both then seduced by a German rich aristocrat named Max(Helmut Griem). Meanwhile Brian works as English teacher for an elegant young Jewish(Marisa Berenson) and his friend Fritz Wendel(Fritz Wippel), both of whom falling in love. All the roles are linked by the Kit-Kat club where perform Sally and an androgynous master of ceremonies(Joel Grey , he deservedly won Oscar to best support cast).<br /><br />It's a magnificent musical-drama well set on Germany where are increasing horrors of Nazism taking place on its grim moments. Atmospheric nostalgia piece from the stories of Christopher Isherwood and successfully creating a portrait of a nation falling into moral decay. It's one of the most perfect examples of accurate timing over a sustained period ever put on cinema. This dynamic film packs excellent musical numbers full of aggression, fire and turn out to be unmissable experience. Liza Minnelli, Michael York and Joel Grey give the acting of their lives. Glamorous and evocative cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth . Based on the John Kander's hit Broadway musical and soundtrack by Ralph Burns full of classic songs. This story was formerly brought to life by Henry Cornelius (1959) with Laurence Harvey(Brian role) and Julie Harris(Sally role) in a good drama no musicalized.<br /><br />¨Cabaret¨ is an impressive picture splendidly directed by Bob Fosse(1927-1987) and winning three Oscars.

            "The Spanish countryside is being plagued by a series of gruesome killings, which gives rise to the legend of The Werewolf of Allariz. Local officials decide to pay for all wolves in the area to be culled, but this doesn't stop the killings. Barbara (Elsa Pataky) a beautiful young girl, begins to suspect her sister's lover. Romasanta (Julian Sands) might be the culprit, only problem is there is a raging sexual chemistry between them, but after her sister and niece disappear, Barbara decides she must act. Romasanta comes clean before a court, that he is in fact a wolf who takes the guise of a man to seduce his victims, is he a wolf or just a psychotic killer? Romasanta is a beautifully filmed period drama, that explores more the myth of the killings than lycantrophy. Those expecting wolf men will be disappointed, but those who like a good story and terrors that are for the most part only alluded to, will enjoy this one. In that regard its very much in the vein of Pacte de Loups. Sands is cleverly cast, his lupine looks adding to the myth, Pataky also provides some nice eye candy.\n",

            "Decidedly off-beat, farcial, incomprehensible story about Countess Dracula(an Elizabeth Bathory type that keeps young bathing in the blood of young, female virgins - or as she says \"wirgins\")and her two vampire sons who run a clothing story called Vamp and have enlisted the aid of a young, American professor of blood. While there is no denying that the film is really going for your funny bone rather than your jugular, much of the humour is hit and miss(mostly miss) akin to a nurse with poor eyesight trying to find a vein with a needle. Academy Award winning actress Louise Fletcher plays Mama Dracula with subtle humour, grace, and charm and looks quite stunning in much of the fashion, but she has virtually nothing to work with in this Belgian horror comedy that relies more on two vampire son boobs for much of the film's motivation. The Wajnberg brothers, Marc-Henri and Alexander, are two strange men indeed. They look quite ridiculous, act even more so, and, despite such elementary things as gaping and running about like two school children much of the time, have glimpses of talent. There is one scene with them doing a pantomime which I rather liked, but the story, the rest of the actors, the less than inspiring direction make this film a far more arduous thing to sit through. Much of the failure of the film must be squarely put on the shoulders of director Boris Szulzinger and his adolescent prowess at showing virtually nothing resembling horror. We see a quite impressive castle with impressive sets, but maybe total three shots of any blood at all - all nothing more than a prick-size bleed. No one is bit on stage so to speak. There are lots of girls showing us their breasts but no action otherwise. The humour is pretty stale stuff too. I like a good horror parody...OK, this is nothing like a good horror parody...but Mama Dracula just doesn't mange to do what a good horror parody does: blend comedy and horror together so as to create something that could be labeled as both legitimately. this film has only Dracula in the title and some scenarios that revolve around the concept of a bloodsucker - beyond that it is nothing more than a mild European sex comedy. Poor Louise Fletcher - she really does and did deserve more than this.\n",

Then there are the silly costumes and antics of the aliens. This film goes to some really low levels. It's about an intervention to save one space culture from another. There are two female leads competing for the attentions of the space hunk. There are a group of silly aliens who keep getting recycled (I'm sure there were only about five actors) and shot. There's a shirtless leader who doesn't dress the way the rest do (he looks like he may have just escaped from the gay pride parade in New York). I don't know. Do things like this make money for their producers. There is nothing here to maintain interest other than the cheese. I've seen so many of them that they don't entertain much anymore.

But When Ziyi Zhang started playing villain, the last drop of hope felt, Zhang's performance is probably the worst performance i've ever seeing, her efforts to sound sexy are in vain, no movie lover will find one of the worst performances ever, sexy. Quaid never impressed me so much, and this one is not an exception, he commits an unacceptable mistake of acting, he doesn't seem real sometimes, the least I want from an actor is for his performance to sound and look real.<br /><br />Like I said, the beginning was promising, but the plot twists are so unbelievable and dumb, that when the final twist came, I could not believe that I wasted two hours of my life watching the worst serial killer movie I had ever seeing, when I could be watching \"The Silence Of The Lambs\" again.<br /><br />Verdict: This is not the movie that's worth watching because it's too bad, it hurts and insult your intelligence, and by don't watching it, you will save yourself for having Zhang's performance in your mind.\n",

Much like the English Patient, they're thinly-veiled envy-pieces in which readers wish they were as glamorous as the gentry. In this case, it's not sufficient that the protagonists be wealthy, landed, titled and surrounded by boatloads of friends, they also need to find themselves at the center of an international cabal (w/o even getting out of bed), who wear clock-face masks, and generally behave like superheros on behalf of Dear Old Britain. It's like a James Bond family reunion.<br /><br />This yarn leaps from the quaint to the absurd, to the improbable, to the over-extended, finally jumping firmly outside the genre boundaries of 'whodunit.' When the over-scaled conclusion finally arrives, somehow it manages to still be unsatisfying and trifling. Christie hasn't figured out the low-effort formula that would keep her up to her ears in cash yet. Regardless, if the plot drew any excitement, it would be fine. But she's way out of her league here and would rarely try anything this far off course again.\n",

Juliet Binoche is outstanding , and Ray Winstone plays a strong support role as a sympathetic detective. Not every one rates Jude Law , but he is well cast in this , and I could not help think that there might be something semi autobiographical in the role that he plays.

For example, before giving Elmo magic clothes to wear to the ball, the Fairy Godperson tells Elmo that what matters is how a person behaves, who you are as a unique person, not what you wear. (Then he says, \"But it's fun to dress up!\" and poof, Elmo is wearing nice clothes.) The princess is kind and gracious. When Bert offers her his paper clip collection, she doesn't laugh, but instead she recognizes that it's one of his favorite possessions and she is honored that he would offer it to her. Oh my, and I LOVE that the genders are mostly switched around. It's a princess, not a prince; Cinderelmo is a boy not a girl; and the Fairy Godperson (in training) is a male -- and wonderful!

Both, good looking funny, semi-talented actors, they have chosen this piece, \"Extreme Dating\", which makes \"Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle\" look like a Shakespearean piece.<br /><br />After four friends go on a skiing trip, and one of them ends up in a dire situation with a strange girl, and falling in love with her afterwards, the rest of the group decides to try 'Extreme dating'. Meaning, they find different scenarios or situations where they can get trapped, kidnapped or isolated with the people they are in love with or have crushes on. <br /><br />The whole movie was pretty lame, and although there were a few funny moments, it's not all that enthralling. I will admit that I watched the movie all the way through, partly because I was bored and the other part was because I like Devon Sawa and wanted to give the film a chance. The girl in the movie, whose name escapes me, has been in a few other films, but she looks like she's gone on Mary-Kate Olsen's diet. She used to be very full-figured, and now she looks almost sick. But, aside from that aspect, she was very good, maybe at times a little over dramatic, but cute.<br /><br />It was worth checking out, but all in all not the best teen - young adult movie you'll see. Stick with better Sawa films like, \"Casper\" and \"Idol Hands\".\n",

I don't suppose that I would have liked it when it first came out because it would have been bunched in with all of the other `rock' musicals of it's time, trying to compete for the `young' in-crowd. Nevertheless, as I look at it now, I see it as a charming film from another era.<br /><br />The plot itself is very interesting and different. It is not your typical `garage band goes to the big city and gets discovered' type of film. They are looking for fame and fortune by way of the champion Greyhound, Mrs. Brown. The rock band thing was just a side interest in this film, much different from other rock musicals of its time. Other `rock' star films of that era were used merely as a publicity showcase for the band to play their music. This film actually had a decent story with some music in it.<br /><br />The cinematography was fabulous in this film. If for anything at all, you should watch it for this aspect alone. I enjoyed the whole film, but the ending was a bit vague. I was able to figure it out after a while, but it jumped from scene to scene without smooth transitions of ideas.\n",

            "Cary Grant and Irene Dunne were great together, and though \"My Favorite Wife\" is not as funny as \"The Awful Truth,\" it's still pretty good. Ellen, lost at sea and presumed dead, returns after 7 years to find her husband Nick has remarried. She goes to his honeymoon hotel, which is a setup for one of Grant's best bits - he sees her as the elevator is closing and his head follows the door until it closes. However, he can't seem to tell his bride Bianca (Gail Patrick). Then he finds out that Ellen wasn't alone on the island but spent the 7 years with one Stephen Burkett. In another funny scene, Ellen gets a sheepish, short, bald shoe salesman to pose as Burkett. Nick has tracked the real Burkett down, and Stephen looks a lot more like Randolph Scott than the shoe salesman. In fact, he's played by Randolph Scott.<br /><br />Grant is his usual riot and extremely handsome. He spends a lot of time talking to himself as he acts out what he's going to say to Bianca. Also, as in \"Bringing Up Baby\" and \"I Was a Male War Bride,\" he gets to do something with women's clothing - this time standing in front a mirror and trying to figure out what to bring Ellen to wear. Dunne is very funny, posing as a southern friend when she meets Bianca, and also is quite touching when she first sees her children.<br /><br />The only problem is that it all gets a little tired, particularly at the end with a prolonged scene having to do with Grant in the attic. As others have pointed out, the script has some holes, particularly the fact that a woman returning after 7 years gets no publicity. And poor Bianca comes off like a villain when she's a victim. Go figure. As amusing as \"My Favorite Wife\" is, it could have been better.<br /><br />Nevertheless, with these stars, it's a delightful film, and some of the funniest scenes take place in the courtroom. The Judge, played by Granville Bates, is hilarious and a good example of \"no small parts.\" He sure makes the most of his role.\n",

            "Arthur survives a car crash, but his brother was not so lucky. When he finally comes around he finds out he's in small country town called Parris and the local mayor tries to get Arthur to become a citizen. Strangely there some offbeat things going on in Paris and when the traumatised Arthur tries to leave he realises that he's trapped in this hell of a town. But what becomes a shock to Arthur is when he discovers the main source of income is that of salvaging parts of passing motorist's car after causing them to have a car accident.<br /><br />Peter Weir's first feature is a kooky, low-budgeted flick that I saw quite awhile back, but I did not remember too much about it, other than the devilishly looking sliver Volkswagen covered with spikes. I actually managed to record it off TV only couple nights ago and I just finally got around to seeing it again. This cult film I still find to be one tasty dark comedy that has a biting satirical edge about it. It ain't a perfect production and the film is highly incoherent, but damn the novelty behind it is far from generic, which made it such an engrossing and energetic exercise. Weir went onto make some prime films in the 70s with \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\" being his most vintage of his work in the period. \"The Cars that Ate Paris\" was a learning step in that right direction and a chance to find his feet. While the enigmatic story leaves many things up in the air with it's odd assortment of characters and ironic turns, but it's Weir's creative style and sly humour that shines through. Some of the satirical comments worked into the picture is that of Australia's obsession with automobiles to that of rebellion with the younger generation disrespecting their elders' terms. Weir is able to poke fun at these points with such nice balance of black humour and the smirking tone of it all really does stick to you without losing its way. There's some unbelievably humorous quotes in the dialogue too. But I actually found some disturbing scenes in the way how this car fetish lifestyle (a guilty sin waiting to break out) has become part of everyday life for the town that the harshness devoted on unexpected motorists is simply part of the parcel. It's a dog eat dog world in Paris. The actual feel of the film towards it deterioration of the town and menacingly, designed cars you could say goes on to find its way into the Mad Max films. Even a little homage of a spaghetti western standoff creeps in. There's not much in a way of suspense and it lumbers about in patches, but when the mayhem escalates it's plain devastating in its terrorising short bursts. The violence on the other hand isn't shy either with being well conceived and there's one memorable aftermath. The rural location and inhabitants of the town are simply alienating in their welcoming vibe and also with an eerie score that gives out a groovy twang that works up the mood rather effectively. There's just something essentially, whimsical about Bruce Smeaton's variety of tunes. The relax performances are adequate even though the characters are pretty much vacant shells, since most of the effort went into the look and thick atmosphere. John Meillon is great as the self-righteous Mayor and Terry Camilleri was solid as the timid Arthur who I actually sympathised for. The manipulative relationship between the Mayor who basically adopts Arthur as a son is an interesting set-up. Another recognizable performance that stood out was Bruce Spence as the very loopy Charlie. Simply a fun movie that's hardly dull, because it rambles along with many awkward situations and black humour.<br /><br />It's not for everyone, but people who are interested in Weir's work or that of odd premises should give it a go.\n",

Not sure what that's all about, there was a protracted 1-2 minute scene with flatulence as the main character. That sort of stuff doesn't bother me so much, but there was other stuff in this movie that just didn't seem right for kids. For example, the \"evil CEO\" character has a mother that works in a scrap metal facility, and at one point the mother says something to her CEO son to the effect of \"you don't want to end up like your father?\" who they then show chained up and hanging around the scrap metal facility - a short segment of the movie which makes an effort to have fathers look bad I guess. Always good for a laugh I guess.<br /><br />It seems pretty common these days for movies that are supposedly for kids to have all sorts of adult topics, themes, and innuendo.

            "It's the story of a married woman falling in love with another man. The married couple - Max von Sydow and Bibi Andersson - does live in fine rapport, their personalities matching well. Both are quiet, contemplative, and very rational persons, not liable to act spontaneous. The intruder - Elliott Gould - on the idyll which they embody together with their teenaged daughter is in contrast an impetuous man, uncompromising, overbearing, and tormented by inner contradictions and compulsions. Andersson tells him at one point that he hates himself. The two clandestine lovers aren't appropriate for each other. They have difficulties to accept the other's social behaviour and stance and don't like it to lie to their environments. But soon they cannot live without each other anymore.<br /><br />The point of the film cannot be to show how two contrary characters complement each other, as Andersson was even more happy with von Sydow before and because it's all told in such a detached manner. The portrait of a love would like to involve the spectators to convey the joy and pain of it. Instead the question why Andersson turns away from von Sydow toward Gould seems intentionally perplexing. The dialogues and acting of the lovers is cerebral and cold, as if they were reciting dazedly on a stage, astounding themselves with their actions and feelings. As if they were actuating on an impulse isolate from their personalities. This impulse or drive is not eros, as especially at the beginning of their affaire sex is more a problem than a fulfilment to these two diffident lovers. Maybe love or the need to feel and give love is itself such a drive, an autonomous thing asserting itself regardless of the circumstances and the characters involved.<br /><br />The central metaphor of the film is a medieval wooden statue of Mary, recently excavated after being buried for centuries - like Gould's and Andersson's potential to be lovers or man and woman. But with the disinterment of the Mary there also come alive insect larvae inside her, corroding her from within. Before they meet Gould attempted suicide and Andersson was reduced to a wife. They flower in their new love and it destroys their lives.<br /><br />Civilization means in many ways the domestication of our impulses. Therefore Andersson realizes that she must not harm lastingly her family and Gould's hidden wife/sister. This is true. But Gould is telling her that she is lying to herself by not eloping with him and he's right, too.\n",

Of course, after the second tape, he moves forward with disastrous results, but Charlotte exposes her secret to Lionel and it is just the thing to shut him up. Naturally, she has to do a lot of praying afterward.<br /><br />Like I said, there is a lot that is funny, and a whole lot that is sad, but isn't that the way relationships are? Alain Resnais got a lot out of some very talented actors and presented a film that was thoroughly enjoyable.\n",

            "This film is by far one of my favorites. I saw it for the first time at the Philadelphia Film Festival in February 2005, and have seen it about five times since then. The American audience seems to regard the film as leftist ideological banter, but they fail to understand the underlying purpose behind the film. Not only is the film a political commentary, but more importantly it is a commentary on human relationships. Once one can understand the motives for the film, one can see how great it is. The ending of course, makes the film. I encourage everyone to see this film at least once, and take it for what it is. Its not a Hollywood blockbuster, but a fantastic examination of both the Western capitalist system, and of human relationships in general. It's a fantastic film, and everyone ought to see it just once.\n",

Possibly the director deserves the blame but the film is a great disappointment. It's not worth seeing.<br /><br />Compare his performance to Lee J. Cobb's tour de force in '66. Cobb breathes life and spirit into this tragic man. And the supporting cast is flawless. Frederick March did a good job back in the '51 film but Cobb IS Willie Loman.

            "Not sure what I expected when I started watching this movie. But as the movie progressed it got more interesting. Jack like most guys is either with or wants to be with many ladies throughout his life. Most is for the physical but a child is produced by one relationship that eventually brings love, responsibility, and sense of purpose to Jack's life. It's kind of a Kramer vs. Kramer as the relationship develops with his child on one hand and his many sexual encounters continues unabated until his love and responsibility for his son override his desire to see still more women.<br /><br />In the end his relationship with his parents which has been strained through most of his life gets comfortable as he see life more clearly as a responsible father.<br /><br />Watch for some very good acting and the efficient way the movie is cut and the story told. My only real complaint is the sound quality was poor and I found it hard to understand the dialog at times. I had to back up the TIVO a number of times to listen to the missed dialog and a few times I was not able to understand what was being said.<br /><br />\n",

            "What a shame... when you have a child actor who is capable of stealing every scene, why not feature him in more scenes? Why not only pick vehicles that'll showcase the incredible talent the kid has? What a riot Spencer Breslin is but unfortunately this movie did not do very well in showing that or showing enough of it. No, the movie wasn't totally about him but golly gee whiz, it shoulda been cause he out-acted and was funnier than anyone else in this movie. Through the first third or so Kid Breslin wasn't really funny much at all. The relationship shown between the brothers was bordering on creepy and was really UnAmerican for the most part... 99% of siblings of that age difference in America just do not act like that. As the movie progresses Spencer's character changes and is pushed out of the spotlight. For the final third of the movie when he's back he's much better, funnier and it is a delight to watch him. He's so funny and for that reason alone I'd recommend this movie and see it again myself. Couple downfalls - the actor who played the dad was not an American. Since this was filmed in New Zealand they used a lot of local actors and the dad was one... and he tried to do an American accent and half the time failed to execute it perfectly. Really an embarrassment. What's interesting is the actresses who played the mom and the blonde girlfriend, along with the dude who played dad, were on, at one time, `Shortland Street' - the most popular soap opera in New Zealand. But in this movie only the dad, to me, clearly appeared to be acting American... he just couldn't pull off a U.S. accent in all his speaking scenes. Terrible. Also very UnAmerican in this movie was the high school band all dressed up in spiffy suits... looked very out of place for what appeared to be a public high school... actually, it did appear to be in place for a high school in New Zealand. AHHHHHHHH.... friggin' producers just can't get it together to film more American movies in America where they should be filmed to give Americans jobs. No, instead they have to go thousands of miles away where actors are cheaper and production is cheaper. And in going that far you have potential to have little things out of place such as what's happened here. But those things didn't mess with the movie too much and what is basic, the story we have in this movie, isn't too bad. I enjoyed it. Wasn't outstanding and I thought it was kinda similar to `Wish Upon a Star' which is seen on The Disney Channel. A.J. Trauth was pretty darn good but for the life of me I couldn't understand why his character would rather be a freak skater instead of the high school football team's quarterback with the hottest cheerleader in school for his girlfriend!??! Beyond me, truly beyond me! Overall this movie's worth it for Spencer Breslin but that's about it. It flows well, it's interesting and it's very family friendly but it's nothing that's very memorable. My grade for this: C\n",

            "When Rankin and Bass unveiled their version of Tolkien's \"The Hobbit\" in 1977, it was a charming if abbreviated made-for-television animated film that was fun and even a bit scary. Their voice casting choices were fine, especially Richard Boone, whose cancer-rasped voice brought the dragon Smaug to life, and Theodore as the creepy and loathsome Gollum, who evoked fear and disgust but little pity. In 1978, Ralph Bakshi attempted to bring the first half of \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy to the big screen in his lushly animated epic. Unfortunately, his big-budget film flopped, much to the disappointment of Tolkien's fans, and Bakshi would be unable to make his sequel. In an effort to finish off the unfinished series, Rankin and Bass tried to make their own version to satisfy the audience who wanted to see closure. It was and remains an unmitigated disaster.<br /><br />Why is this cartoon so awful? Well, the answer lies mainly in the word \"cartoon\". Unlike The Hobbit, which featured beautifully painted scenery that evoked delicate watercolors and ethereal linework, which had so evidently been crafted with loving care and cast with thought to matching characters to actors, The Return of the King had all the earmarks of having been hastily cobbled together. It wasn't so much an animated homage to a great writer's work as a hatchet job. A huge chunk of the events in Tolkien's books were missing between where Bakshi's fairly faithful rendition ended and this abomination began. The drawings were slapped together and were often repetitious and ugly. Voice actors from the first film returned and some of them worked: Orson Bean was fine as Frodo, Theodore was again great as Gollum, Theodore Bikel did a fine job as Aragorn, and Roddy McDowall was wonderful as Samwise Gamgee. The rest were abysmal. Instead of hiring actors to do the characters, cartoon voice actors such as Don Messick (Scooby-Doo) and Casey Kasem (Shaggy) were cast. It was downright painful to hear a Nazgull being done by Scooby Doo through a distortion filter. Many characters integral to Tolkien's story were cast away: Where was Gimli? Faromir? Any of the elves (other than Elrond) such as Legolas or Glorfindel? How about the Army of the Dead or Sauroman? Merry and Pippin didn't develop as characters; Gollum remained merely vile, as if Bakshi's attempts to show this tortured being's strangely noble and pathetic side never happened. The dialog was stilted and sometimes unintentionally hilarious (\"As the flag's standard broke the wind. . .\"). It was awful beneath description from beginning to end, appearing to be a shameless attempt to cash in on the hopes of frustrated fans who'd wanted the second animated movie made.<br /><br />That, of course, was the entire problem. This cartoon was, despite its trappings and claims, just a cartoon, less charming by far than The Hobbit and far less noble than Bakshi's film. Both of those were honest attempts at creating art, and each succeeded in its limited way until swept aside by Peter Jackson, who finally gave Tolkien's opus the treatment it deserved. The two earlier films merit a place of honor for trying to achieve cinematic beauty. Rankin and Bass's The Return of the King deserves to simply be forgotten.\n",

            "Haunted House (2004) is a waste of digital space upon a D.V.D. disc I have ever seen. I have watched crappy movies before but this has to be worst thing I have ever seen. This did not even resemble a movie in the least. The structure, lighting, writing, acting and direction is the pits. I cannot believe this \"movie\" was even distributed in a major video rental chain store. I mean I can not find one thing good to say about it. The flick was padded out to the extreme and the film makers seemed to have run out of ideas and other ways to extend the running time past seventy minutes.<br /><br />The \"movie\" begins with some thirty something frat boys hanging outside of what appears to be a spooky \"house\". They seem to be reliving and old urban legend about people disappearing inside a ghost house. If you have heard the tale before it's old news (a \"kid\" walks in and never comes out and the frat boys come and and find him dead of fright, the boys soon fall victim to a death curse). The tale is told by a really bad film maker, he convinces his friends (A group of old teenagers) to hang out inside and outside an empty structure that looks like a cross between a barn and a large doll house. After torturing the audience with some of the worst movie making the world has ever since (I have seen Cable Access shows with better film making skills and production) they give us a cheap payoff by repeating what happened in the beginning. The movie ends with voice-overs, still pictures and rehashed footage.<br /><br />They should take all the copies of this movie and bury them with the million copies of unsold E.T. Atari 2600 games out there in the New Mexico desert. Asylum should also be punished for helping to release this garbage. This movie failed all the simple logical steps that are needed to create a watchable movie. Haunted House had no acting, lame writing, terrible direction, no lighting and gutter level production values.<br /><br />Avoid like the plague!\n",

            "SPOILER WARNING<br /><br />The original Homeward Bound story is a fascinating story of wide panoramic settings, a strong bond between the three animals, Shadow, Sassy and Chance and a pledge with one another to walk home to San Francisco despite the miles and miles of dangerous wilderness between them. The three main characters are well rounded, interesting, and you care about them so much that the human characters seem somewhat less relevant (though not entirely because they serve as motivation for the characters to when they will return home).<br /><br />This however, is not.<br /><br />We're at a point where the family is preparing to go camping in Canada, but after a paranoid Chance cocks things up by thinking he's being abandoned, the animals stupidly run away from the airport and find themselves down the back streets of San Francisco.<br /><br />The animals seem to meander around the city mindlessly, dodging two very thick men working for illegal testing labs and two incredibly irritating strays (one of whom dubiously has a voice uncannily similar to Mike Tyson), team up with a gang of other misanthrope strays now and again (even more insufferable with some of the awful garbagy lines spouted out), and in general, the film doesn't seem to know what to do with itself, because as we all know, since these animals successfully navigated an entire wilderness for miles and miles last time, a city would be pretty small potatoes! We even fill the gap by having a bit where a kid is saved from a burning house! Any minute, I would expect Rin-Tin-Tin to come up with his attorney with a cease-and-desist note and threats of suing for copyright (and to be honest, I wouldn't blame him)! It is so bone-idle, that it in fact levers in a cheesy romance plot between Chance and a stray called Delilah! What were the writing team thinking when they cooked this up? My only conclusion: They're all raving lunatics! We don't need a stupid romantic sub-plot levered into these films, it's totally superfluous! To make this story aggravatingly boneheaded, we even have a love rival by the way of another irritating redneck-drawling stray dog with the brains of a kipper! (For some reason, they use a Grand-Bleu De Gascogne for this, sadly a very rare dog, which would smack of doggie racism, unless it perhaps indicates that the writers hate the French and the rednecks.) I also wonder why Chance still behaves like a terminally-naive puppy despite his last experiences in the wilderness which would surely have taught him a thing or two! Not forgetting, in the first film, Chance explained that before he was adopted he was a stray dog, and was abandoned when still a puppy, so he'd know a little about living on the streets don't you think? The conclusion that wraps up the film's stories is cringe worthy to the point of wanting to put your foot through the telly! I won't reveal it, but if you look at the rest of the film, a climax of this film will not be worth the case it is carried in! Stick to Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. At least that way you can pretend that this Godawful mess never existed and enjoy the better original. Watching this sequel may result in you hurling yourself in front of a freight train! You have been warned!\n",

            "The first 95 minutes or so -- up to the eclipse -- is possibly the best movie to date in 2006. It's a voyage of discovery through a virgin world of alien but understandable sensations and it culminates in an arrival at a city of pyramids which constitutes one of the recent cinema's great set pieces. Bizarre, spectacular, hypnotic, fully realized -- like landing on an alien planet of savage, fascinating beauty. After the eclipse, however, the movie settles into a conventional \"chase\" mode which, though interesting, can't compare to the first 95 minutes. The ending disappoints in that it introduces an outside element to this previously enclosed world, and the ending can't resolve the movie's basic dilemma: how can it be both the story of a civilization's decline and also the story of a man's personal triumph.<br /><br />The subtitles actually help in that lines which might have sounded silly or stilted when spoken in English somehow \"work\" when condensed to printed form. (Though one subtitle stumbles with a piece of discordant slang.) These subtitles also help create a distance between the modern audience and the lost world of the past being shown on the screen. And words, either spoken or subtitled, often aren't needed here because the cast has great faces and can use these faces to convey both information and emotion.<br /><br />Though not a fan of \"The Passion of the Christ\" and though feeling that \"Braveheart\" was overrated, it's thumbs up for Mel Gibson's \"Apocalypto.\"<br /><br />(If only we could get rid of that ungrammatical ad-line: \"No one can outrun their destiny.\")\n",

            "Totally pointless and exceedingly boring low-budget sequel to the surprisingly popular and yet, disappointing first film that starts off promisingly enough as it shows in black and white a young deformed boy being tortured by a group of teenage thugs that call themselves \"The Blood Wings\"...or something similar to that. However, after that opening sequence the film takes a drastic nose-dive into the land of really cheap horror flicks as it becomes very hokey (cringe-worthy even) and nonsensical ultimately causing the viewer to heave a huge sigh of relief once the film has ended! Overall, the only true highlights in this sorry excuse for a film are the few short scenes of a rather luscious-looking Solei Moon-Frye (from \"Punky Brewster\" fame) in a small supporting role as an occult obsessed teen, and an admittedly creepy atmosphere which seems to mysteriously dissipate altogether after the first half-hour passes.

            "Although many Ken Maynard features are noted for their lack of believability in the story telling, there was something about his on screen presence that makes us watch him -- he just comes off as the 'real thing.' You could see it in the way he would instinctively pat or interact with his horse(!!) and delivering such dialog to the heroine as, \"Miss Jenny, you spill a kinda mean loop yourself. You've got me just as good as throwed and hog tied already.\" To which Jenny replies, \"That makes me awfully happy, Ken.\" Woo! they don't make movies like this any more!<br /><br />This one is thoroughly enjoyable and has a touch of mysterious creepiness. \"The Phantom,\" dressed all in black with a bat-like cape, inhabits Tombstone Canyon, where he picks off with a shotgun various hands of the Lazy S ranch. Ken shows up there on his way to find out the identity of his father, but gets involved with Jenny Lee (Cecelia Parker) at her father's ranch branding and 'dehorning' cattle. <br /><br />For more of Cecelia before her Andy Hardy movies, check out the serial \"The Lost Jungle\" (1934) and the John Wayne \"Riders of Destiny\" (1933).<br /><br />The Western elements all build quickly; in fact, it begins with Ken being ambushed in the Canyon by an unknown gang. Then we swiftly get fist fights, the romance (\"Let's go get the ring!\"), Ken being framed and jailed for murder, and shoot outs in Tombstone Canyon. There's one too many visits to Tombstone Canyon, and the final hunt down for Ken there goes too slowly. <br /><br />But then we have a great action finale with 'The Phantom,' Alf Sykes, his son and Ken all fighting or hanging off the highest cliff while Jenny and her father's men speed to the rescue with Ken's horse 'Tarzan.'<br /><br />A good 1930s western, mainly because of Ken Maynard.\n",

Mask teaches an important lesson about life: it doesn't matter what a person looks like, its what is inside that counts. i only wish that rocky could have lived longer, to achieve everything he wanted to. the fact that the story is actually true makes this film all the more poignant and profoundly moving. i would urge people who haven't seen it already: rent it out, or buy it. it will soften even the hardest of hearts.\n",

In any case this Real World show is just one of many BS crap programs that MTV is replacing their music videos with. The kids that have been on every Real World show have no idea what the real real world is. For if they did they would not be on this program. The producers put these spoiled kids up in million dollar homes or whatever, pay for trips to other countries and give them all kinds of things to do. All they have to do is complain, fight and be offended by things that are not politically correct. The line up for the real World cast is normally this: Black guy, black girl, white feminist girl with hang-ups, macho jerk white guy, wimpy white guy and of course a homosexual. They all have to be people that get easily offended and act like total boneheads.<br /><br />I can see this being called the real world if they placed these dumb kids in the projects in Chciago or some of the poorest, dirtiest places on the planet. That would be fun to watch these hand-held kids deal with that. MTV has no idea what the real world is because they are so lost in their PC world of transparent nonsense.\n",

            "My Goodness, what a bomb! We didn't drop anything this big on Iraq!<br /><br />Perfect is the story of a Rolling Stone reporter (Travolta) who trips over his ethics, or lack there of while writing two big stories. His first story deals with a computer tycoon in hot water with the U.S. government for selling his products to an Eastern-Bloc country. This angle is played way up considering the lack of details we are told about the situation. No matter, the story you will remember deals with a swanky health club in L.A.. Travolta wishes to write a piece about how health clubs in the 1980s are replacing the singles bars of the 1970s as the #1 place for people to meet. Take that premise and see how long you can stretch it. Director Bridges apparently thought he could drag it out for nearly two hours and still keep our attention.<br /><br />This film suffers from a severe lack of focus. There are too many location changes to count. There is also too much running around and too much time wasted on insignificant little things. For example, what was up with Travolta's sudden trip to Morocco near the end of the film. It had no purpose what so ever! Another problem this film has is its tendency to drag out every scene to last as long as whatever cheesy 80s dance song is playing in the background. That gets old pretty darn quick.<br /><br />This film is also hopelessly dated in terms of fashion. If any guy came into my health club wearing tights or a fish-net tank top, he'd probably get beaten up. Bridges & CO also try to recycle a gag that worked in Urban Cowboy. In that film, there was a scene featuring numerous women dressed up for a Dolly Parton look-alike contest. In this film, we get about a hundred people dressed up as Boy George in a scene at a hotel. In Urban Cowboy it worked since there was a legitimate reason for all the people to dress that way. They were at least trying to win a contest. The scene in Perfect is useless and it only serves to date the film even further. <br /><br />This film was by no means Travolta's worst. Has anyone seen The Experts or Shout? This film did, however, have his most embarrassing scene. In it, he's sweating away in Jamie Lee Curtis's aerobics class and doing a never-ending series of pelvic thrusts to the dance beat. His crotch has obviously been stuffed with a sock, or perhaps the thing Hammer used in his Pumps in a Bump video. Truly hilarious!<br /><br />Travolta is a talented actor, but he has nothing to work with here. Jamie Lee Curtis is also a great talent, but she is wasted as well. She looks absolutely gorgeous, but her character is so moody and abrasive that we can hardly stand her. The supporting cast of mostly unknowns fills out their respective stereotypical roles as well as they can.<br /><br />In all, this is a poor film on all levels. It tries to be an insightful look at journalistic ethics and falls flat on its face. It comes off as being little more than a two hour plug for Rolling Stone Magazine. Too Bad.<br /><br />3 of 10 stars<br /><br />So sayeth the Hound.\n",

This well-made by intensely boring British horror offering features good direction from Andrew Goth, who displays a strong visual style and a good eye for interesting camera angles.

The make-up effects were quite good, and if you like your horror movies gorywell, let's just say this is a VERY bloody flick and horror fans will not be disappointed in this department. Unfortunately, this is where the list of positive aspects ends. The plot is a big confusing mess, the violence is often mean-spirited, the narrative made no sense and the film is very poorly paced.

            "This must be one of the most annoying, arrogant, poser films I've ever seen. What a waste of budget and actors. Angelopoulos has reached new levels of pretentiousness. It is clear there is virtually no plot, even if this part of Greek history is material for great movies. He simply had some supposedly symbolic (actually shambolic) scenes in his mind and he built a whole movie around them. Death is the main theme and is repeated ad nauseam, along with litanies, processions and the like, which should only be a vehicle for the movie but unfortunately it is the movie itself. A totally incoherent result, which can only leave you saying \"huh?\" or \"oh dear\" every two minutes. <br /><br />There is no character development at all, nada, zilch. I'm usually complaining about some movies having two-dimensional characters, but oh boy, he managed to create one-dimensional characters. This is irritating for us and degrading for some of the actors. He even managed to make one of my favourite Greek actors, Giorgos Armenis, seem wooden. <br /><br />And going to the core of Angelopoulos film-making: No we're not idiots. We do not want chewed food. Please someone tell this guy symbolism has to be subtle. Theo do you really underestimate your audience so much or you're simply incompetent? Personally, I think he tried to make a Greek \"Underground\". No matter how he tries, he can't reach Kusturica.<br /><br />Only saving grace: Photography, costumes and the music.\n",

The film starts with a very sarcastic and sometimes funny tone, but when the violence starts things get so dark that the movie almost becomes unwatchable. It never earns the dark shift that the latter half, the massacre requires. The audience is suddenly asked to feel bad for these rather idiotic characters (I'm using that term loosely), but instead we really feel nothing, and that is what makes this movie so disgusting. <br /><br />*Spoiler* The death of the Bible Girl, played by Misty Mundae, is probably the worst out of the bunch. Suddenly the killers get this hard, sexual edge, and things just get to dark. When she is finally asked to insert the barrel of a shotgun into her mouth to simulate oral sex, the movie just went to far. The comedy and wit is gone, replaced by a very unnerving and perverted shock. I can normally handle this stuff, but these characters are meant to be high school students, and Misty can actually pass for one. <br /><br />If you want to be offended, you will be, but this film is a mess when it comes to tone. The shifts are to drastic, and in the end, the film just feels sleazy and cheap. I love exploitation films, but this one is a bit to much.\n",

Here's why this movie sucks.<br /><br />To sum up the movie, I steal from oshram-3 (One of the other comments) \"The plot of Taxi follows Detective Washburn (Jimmy Fallon, making his debut as a movie lead) and bike-messenger-turned-cab-driver Belle (Queen Latifah) as they inadvertently get tangled up with one another and have to figure out who is ripping off a series of Manhattan banks and try to catch them. Rounding out the cast (no pun intended) are Jennifer Esposito (you might remember her from Spin City) as Washburn's lieutenant, Marta, and supermodel Gisele Bundchen as the head hot chick.\"<br /><br />Luc Besson's action-comedy Taxi(1998) was a great movie, mostly due to decent acting, funny characters and social/cultural references. In this American remake, all that is gone. <br /><br />The characters in themselves are severely less intricate than in Besson's original, and maybe the best of them all is gone. I am, of course, talking about the utterly insane police captain. Then again, of course the Americans would leave him out, since he's a parody of every single angry police chief in American movies. All that's left is Queen Latifah driving a taxi, and a cop that's just pathetic, and doesn't have that likable quality Frédéric Diefenthal had in the french version.<br /><br />Also, the political correctness really shines through the gaps in this film. Every single strong character is a woman. The only guy in the entire core group of the movie is the awkward cop/disguise artist. The movie has been carefully constructed so it doesn't lash out at any particular groups in society, and by doing that, you lose the edge.<br /><br />I see this movie as a blatant attempt to salvage careers and make some money on the fact that Americans don't like subtitles. It's also a classic example of what happens when you let lawyers and politically correct groups scare you out of doing things right.\n",

I think it was wonderful that they changed the role of the child from a boy to a girl just for her. She made this film, made it work and made you believe. It's a feel good film. It teaches patience and perseverance. It shows kids and adults alike what can come from hard work. I thought it was a very inspiring film. Made me remember what it was like to be a kid, when everything was possible. See this movie, you won't regret it...unless you have a heart of stone. It made me treasure the moments between a father and a daughter, having lost my dad this year. I miss him and I wish we'd had a bonding moment like the ones in the film. And it was good to see Kurt Russell again. He's always been a favorite of mine. And now I can add another movie to my list of all time faves.\n",

            "I bought \"Frightmare\" for six bucks at Circuit City thinking that it was the early 80's version. Imagine my surprise when I pop in the DVD and find a straight to video horror film from the year 2000! I'm a fan of said independent films, so I wasn't upset. I decided to give the film its due diligence.<br /><br />The Good: <br /><br />- Some pretty good scares in this movie. A lot of them are \"jump scares\" and \"loud music tomfoolery,\" but this film should give you a jump or two, at any rate.<br /><br />- Some decent atmospheric elements. The Haunted House is pretty cool. Some of the \"stalking\" scenes (the one at the beginning and the one in the middle) are suitably creepy and fairly well done.<br /><br />- The two main actresses are actually decent actors. The rest of the cast, however, are not very good at all. Said actresses also provide ample \"eye candy,\" if you like tight outfits, leather pants, etc. =) - The killer's outfit/mask/demeanor is also suitably creepy.<br /><br />The Bad: <br /><br />- Really bad editing. The movie jumps around a lot. Some of the editing tricks are neat, but overall, it pulls you out of the movie. The editing also makes the plot confusing at times.<br /><br />- Soundtrack is suspect. The \"creepy music\" is good, but the soundtrack often relies on a drum machine/bad techno score to fill in the quiet parts. It doesn't work very well.<br /><br />- The \"twist\" at the end had the ultimate potential for coolness, but the aforementioned bad editing made it fall flat. This is the wasted potential I'm referring to.<br /><br />- Sub par acting. As I mentioned earlier, the two main actresses are good, but the rest of the cast comes off like a bad high school play.<br /><br />Other notes: <br /><br />Note the names of the main characters...Freddy, Jason, Norman, Michael and Hellraiser. Subtle.<br /><br />You can see a lot of \"Scream\" influence in this film. It's interesting to see what is inspiring the next generation of filmmakers.<br /><br />Overall: <br /><br />I give it a 4 out of 10. Lots of wasted potential here, but the movie is very watchable if you enjoy these types of low budget, independent films. I don't regret spending the six bucks at all.\n",

Firstly, the wife finds a body or bodies. Gee, the husband seems okay that the police not be called - afterall the wife reckons the bodies are 'old'. Gee, that's enough for the husband to want to let wifey keep her bodies in the cellar, and to keep her happy. Unbelievable. And then, as if this weren't enough to swallow, suddenly there's a knock on the door with a guy warning the hubbie the wifey's been possessed. Luckily I did not see it in some trendy art film festival - i would have burst out laughing.<br /><br />I turned this awful movie off after that - enough is enough.

Several scenes consist of the main characters watching the televised pontifications of the producers. . .not exactly very gripping. The packaging claims that the film was 'Shot on location on six continents' and I guess that is technically correct- of course the stock footage was shot by _someone else_-- seems a little misleading for a film destined for the Christian market. The soundtrack is perhaps the one thing that saves the film, and features popular songs from top names in Christian music.\n",

            "Until seeing Mabel Cheung's \"Song jia huang chao\" (\"The Soong Sisters\" in English), I had never even heard of the Soong sisters. The movie does a really good job focusing on their childhood leading to the establishment of the Republic of China, and then the sisters' associations with important figures in China's history. Ching-ling (Maggie Cheung) married Sun Yat-sen, May-ling (Vivian Wu) married Chiang Kai-shek, and Ai-ling (Michelle Yeoh) married H. H. Kung, although his role is minimized. Large portions of the movie seem to be about the visuals, as we see the elegant setting in which the sisters grew up.<br /><br />The film came out the same year that Hong Kong got returned to China, so it might have had the aim of getting the two off to a good start. Of course, they had to include lines very favorable to the PRC, namely: \"Before, we were slaves of old China. Now, we are slaves of slaves of old China.\" Overall, this one could appropriately accompany a showing of Steven Spielberg's \"Empire of the Sun\". I certainly recommend it. Also starring Winston Chao, Hsing-kuo Wu, Zhenhua Niu, Elaine Jin and Wen Jiang.\n",

            "Based on the story 'The Forbidden' by Hellraiser writer and director Clive Barker, Candyman is another tale of people delving into places where they shouldn't delve and otherworldly evil. Rather than a demon from hell, the antagonist of this tale is an urban legend going by the name of Candyman. The mythology behind the story is one of the film's major plus points, and director Bernard Rose does a good job of building it. The mythology combined with what can only be described as a fetid atmosphere bode well together, and ensures that this film is both a creepy and absorbing tale of horror. The film follows a pair of University students; Helen Lyle and Bernadette Walsh doing a thesis on urban legends. They decide to research the modern day myth of 'Candyman', a figure who appears complete with a hooked hand to savage whomever stupid enough to say his name five times in front of the mirror. However, one of the duo starts to put a bit too much effort into the work, and ends up coming a cropper when Candyman decides to have his wicked way with her.<br /><br />The parts of the story that stand out the most are the relationship between the protagonist and Candyman, and the idea of a community of people believing in title character. However, this is where the film falls down to me. The scenes between Helen and Candyman put too much focus on the 'evil' dialogue, and the relationship is never really built upon. The urban legend theme is often touched upon, but we only meet a handful of characters that believe in the almighty Candyman, and they aren't in the film for long. The basis of the story follows Helen's bid for sanity, and while this provides an interesting backbone for the film - I really do think it could have been a lot better. The casting is largely good, with Tony Todd putting across an effective portrayal of Candyman, and Virginia Madsen delivering a believable performance as the film's victim. Xander Berkeley, who came to fame recently with a role in the first two series' of 24 rounds off the cast, which is under the direction of Bernard Rose. The only other film I've seen from him is Paperhouse, and Candyman is certainly a lot better than that. Although that isn't exactly difficult. Overall, this is a creepy and interesting film; but I can't say I'm a huge fan of it.\n",

Generally, movies with multiple twists and turns can be great fun, but this one is so contrived that it tried my patience.

            "I didn't like this one. It's based on a very interesting idea, that the enormity and complexity of the universe can be reduced to a single, simple equation. Nowadays they'd build a whole series around that concept. Unfortunately that idea got lost in an impenetrable storyline that left me decidedly flummoxed by end credits. Let me admit right here that a big part of my attraction to the X-Files is its plot contrivances and normally vague resolutions. I think anyone who really likes the show must feel the same way, especially if you stayed tuned in through the last couple seasons. But this episode takes the usual confusion associated with the program to another level. I would wager anything that none of the actors, Gillian Anderson, Annabeth Gish, nor Robert Patrick (and certainly not Burt Reynolds), could make heads or tails of this mess if you asked them about it, even as they were shooting it. In fact, I would challenge even the writers of the show to articulate exactly what's going on here. You see, I cannot give any concise summary of the episode because its impossible. Of course I did rather enjoy the playful tone of the episode. However it would take a lot more charm than Mr. Evening Shade could ever offer to distract from the inanity of the plot. Actually I don't know if I should even call it a plot. And I doubt anyone disagrees because to this point no one else has posted anything about 'Improbable'. For fans willing to sit through the episode it's hard to acknowledge how bad it is.\n",

Joffrey's character, too, is interestingly developed, and gives credibility as to why he should be drawn to character like that of Haskell. I do not see Haskell's failure to kill Joffrey as inconsistent. Rather, it suggests that Haskell has some redeeming qualities and, like the rest of us, is not all bad. One can understand why he would hesitate to kill a child, not least because he senses the boy's admiration for him. Kenneth Colley provides an excellent supporting role . His willingness to die without further treatment in order to help his ex-wife financially suggests a certain nobility of character. I certainly do not agree with the reviewer's dismissal of the film as second rate. It has a style and quality of its own which makes it enjoyable to watch and provokes thought.\n",

            "Loosely based on the story of Richard Davis who was killed by fellow soldiers in Columbus, Georgia after returning from Iraq in 2003, In the Valley of Elah, Paul Haggis' first feature since his Oscar winner Crash is a poignant reminder of how war robs people of their humanity. In one of the best performances of his career, Tommy Lee Jones is Hank Deerfield, a career military man whose son Mike (Jonathan Tucker) is reported as AWOL from his New Mexico base after returning from eighteen months in Iraq. What Hank discovers in searching for Mike is enough to shake his faith in an institution that had nurtured him and threaten his entire world view.<br /><br />Though Deerfield is an ex-military man who knows the value of discipline and hyper-efficiency, he is a man who carries the scars of the death of his other son, killed in a military training accident. When he learns about Mike's disappearance, he tries to calm the fears of his wife Joan (Susan Sarandon), but one can sense in the lines of sadness etched in his worn face that he is very worried. In a very prophetic scene, as he sets out for the Army base to conduct his own investigation, he notices that an American flag is flying upside down, a symbol of international distress, and stops to teach the groundskeeper the difference.<br /><br />At the base, Deerfield is thwarted by the stonewalling of the military and the inept local police force and cannot get anywhere with Lt. Kirklander (Jason Patric) who is in charge of the missing person operation. Fortunately, he finds a detective Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron) who is assigned to the case. Taunted by chauvinist fellow detectives who think she slept her way onto the squad, she is eager to prove herself as capable as her detractors. When Deerfield's body is discovered, gruesomely cut up in an open field, Deerfield and Sanders work together to piece together the puzzle, suspecting the involvement of drugs and drug dealers. With the help of video left on Mike's cell phone, however, he discovers secrets that begin to shake his faith in American institutions though he never questions his son's actions.<br /><br />In one of the most moving sequences in the film, Hank tells Sanders little boy the biblical story of David who killed the giant Goliath with a slingshot in the valley of Elah. Deerfield soon understands, however, that it is not enough to fight your own fears in standing up to an adversary but it is necessary to treat the enemy as a human being while still doing your job. Mike and his fellow soldiers have been unable to erase the ugly violence they perpetrated on civilians in Iraq and have brought this self hatred home. In spite of a too literal ending that robs us of the power of our imagination and borders on the polemic, In the Valley of Elah is a compelling and moving film that makes certain we do not forget what the war in Iraq has done not only to our soldier's bodies but to their minds and souls as well.\n",

The conformity, the outbreaks, the restrictions.... its all very real, and that's what I love about it! The only thing stopping me from giving it a full 10, was the fact that I didn't like the ending very much, even though the suicide was a shock, the whole thing about Mr Keating getting kicked out didn't entertain me at all. Another part of the movie I don't think is adequate is the scene in which Knox Overstreet is at the party with Chris.

In any given year there has to be one show that is the worst of the lot, but this show may well hold that distinction for the entire decade. I stumbled onto this while trying to find something that was similar to other shows that I do like, such as Carnivale, which is also an apocalyptic tale with overt religious content. I also LOVE David Selter's \"The Omen\" and one or two of its sequels. Plus I have enjoyed Bill Pullman's work in other programs and movies. Sadly, neither Seltzer or Pullman seemed to have exerted any special effort on this throw-away. \"The end is Here,\" to which I add \"and not soon enough!\"\n",

            "I've been waiting for the moment when I'd finally see the third installment of the Crow saga. The moment came last night; and I must say that it might not be he best movie ever, but it was worth the waiting and the time spent in seeing it. I felt I was back into the dark, windy world to which the crow brings those troubled souls to \"put wrong things right\".<br /><br />Another thing I'd like to comment is that (and kill me if you want, How do you kill someone who's already dead) I actually liked the Crow:City of Angels, and that I found this movie not better than its predecessor but different. It has a different mood, a different tone and a different feeling. This one has more action but is not as violent. And again, Eric mabius is not a better crow than Vincent Perez, it is just different. His character is more direct and he is not afraid to kill innocent people for his purpose, as opposite of the other two.<br /><br />Scars instead of paint, and the poetic quotations are missing, I liked that, that makes the motivation of the character more visceral and organic and painful; a way to drag his sacrifice as a reminder. And of course, a guy who's here for a purpose and won't leave until it's finished. If something like that would happen to me, I would definitely do the same thing, and that's why the crow appeals to much to me and it always will.\n",

            "This is Izo:<br /><br />Izo is about a character who represents the unacceptable in society. The good and the bad parts simultaneously: He is the progressive spirit that rains righteous wrath upon the corruption in religion, government and the world of finance, freeing man from oppressive rulers. And he is the barbarism of which the human animal is capable when running unchecked and uncontrolled; unrestrained. He represents these aspects of the human spirit up through history, and must finally end his existence when man has attained the purity to cast off oppression for good and eradicate his own barbaric tendencies through moral discipline and self-control. Izo is humanity's anger, righteous and frustrated; resolute and indignant, leading us towards utopia while cutting a swath through the sadly ignorant masses that would oppose him.<br /><br />Izo is a movie loaded with symbolism, and every drop of blood is artistically justified. Even so, it is nowhere near as clear as it could have been, and the entertainment value is merely so-so. Generally a cool movie, not overly pleasant, but certainly a radical artistic statement of solid integrity.<br /><br />My rating: 8 out of 10.\n",

Shot on an obviously low budget with minimal casting and mininimal locations (i.e. one room) it achieves maximum tension and maximum freakishness without actually being overtly freaky. A completely different viewing experience from what the ordinary filmic audience is used to.The acting was superb from the main character and my only quarm with the entire production is the last few seconds could have been a little more in the same vein and less showy (not in an f/x sense but more in a well,was it him or was it the mirror?

Kim Manners' direction is beautiful, dragging all the misery and despair out of every raindrop and wet pair of jeans. The script is tight and full of lovely little moments, the not-as-daft-as-they-look locals who believe in the monster as long as it sells merch are especially funny and accurate. Chris Ellis and Timothy Webber give the principals stirling support, both giving vibrant performances that are a joy.

            "A nine year old Brooklyn boy nicknamed \"Ceddie\" (Freddie Bartholomew), beloved by all who know him due to his kindly nature, finds himself in for a most unexpected change of lifestyle when he learns he's to be heir to the estate of his grandfather (C. Aubrey Smith), a British Earl and has to move in with him. A bigger challenge for the boy to overcome though is to bring down the barrier between his stubborn, set in his ways grandfather and Ceddie's mother \"Dearest\" (Dolores Costello), who the Earl resents his son marrying as she's an American.<br /><br />This one really grabs you by the heartstrings and doesn't let up. Freddie Bartholomew is simply wonderful as \"Ceddie\", wonderfully capturing his character and winning over the viewing audience's hearts in fairly short time, no easy feat for a child star. C. Aubrey Smith too is just marvelous as the crotchety old grandfather who finds his stubborn, hard-hearted, icy exterior being worn away just by being in the presence of such a terrific young lad who loves him unconditionally. Dolores Costello too was nicely cast and delivers the goods when she's called upon to do so. It's the likable performances given by these stars that make this a real winner in that we're truly made to care about these characters and what happens to them.\n",

            "I saw this movie a few times in the theater in 1980, when I was 12, and at the time it was pretty much utterly awesome. However, as we are forced to face again and again, what is awesome when one is 12 is not the same as what is awesome when one is over 30.<br /><br />This movie forces us to look inside ourselves and ask: \"What would happen if a state-of-the-art (for 1980) aircraft carrier were transported back in time to the eve of Pearl Harbor?\" Then there are all the regular questions about the Prime Directive, the ethics of using advance knowledge and advanced technology, blah blah blah. The situation is the hook of the movie, a pretty good one. Unfortunately, it's also the only thing the movie has to offer.<br /><br />After some exposition that gets top military whiner Martin Sheen on the boat, and some unrelated techo-fetishism about the way those sweet F-14s land, a mysterious storm that looks a lot like a laser and a fog machine appears in the sky and causes the sailors to hold their heads. When it goes away, they are in 1941 (the year, not the movie), and they have to grapple with many philosophical questions about whether they should whup the Japs' asses but good.<br /><br />A good 35% of the movie is just flat-out recruiting-film military techno fetishism. It's kind of cool for a while, as you watch planes swoosh and dive, and it reminds you of the days when the prospect of going into the military meant you were going to fly cool planes and do cool things instead of simply being sent to a desert to be killed. But it gets tiresome after awhile, though it does remain quite visible, so you can fast-forward without fear of missing anything.<br /><br />There's a small bit of derisive laughter as the crew (during the LONG period in which they are coming to accept that they have traveled back in time) compare a photo that was apparently taken an hour ago by one of their planes to a photo that was taken 40 years previously by another plane. The cast bravely pretends not to notice that they are THE EXACT SAME PHOTO. Amazing coincidence! There's another movie right there.<br /><br />The performances fit the material. Kirk Douglas is actually quite charming as the captain. He projects authority, yet is warm and approachable, and isn't afraid to say he doesn't know what's going on. Martin Sheen appears to be on hand simply to deliver speeches about how very morally complex it all is. Former Superfly Ron O'Neal is around as eye candy for me. Katherine Ross is in full \"do I have to do anything except stand around and be dewy?\" mode, but she will always get props from me for ensnaring gravelly man-hunk Sam Elliott in her wicked web.<br /><br />This movie is a bit like those alternative history novels, which are usually about \"what if the South won the Civil War,\" which translates as;\"what if we'd kept the blacks in their place.\" This one, I think, is about redressing the perceived imbalance that occurred when the US was caught unawares. But how could we be caught unawares we're the United States! I think the enjoyment of this movie for some people is in floating the fantasy that we could show them Japs once and for all.<br /><br />This movie is also notable as a likely influence on 80s rock group Europe's cheesy hit of the same title.<br /><br />SPOILERS>>> The end of this movie cops out by having the mysterious storm appear at the PRECISE moment that the US is just about to attack the Japanese fleet. The aircraft carrier is transported back to the same time it left, everyone shrugs and goes \"Huh,\" and they go about their average workday. It makes the movie somewhat unsatisfying at the end, but you know not any more unsatisfying than it was up until that point.<br /><br />--- Hey, check out Cinema de Merde, my website devoted to bad and cheesy movies.

            "With the sudden death of Stanley Kubrick recently a part of my love for film died along with him as I recognized the unfortunate fact that there was no other director alive to closely heed the call for attention to detail and visceral content. The thought of looking to Steven Spielberg for future answers was almost unbearable as I remembered that his originality often gives way to family fare (The Pinnochio finale of `Artificial Intelligence') in an attempt to pad his already overloaded wallet. I thought about Sam Mendes and cringed as I remembered that for him art was a floating grocery bag with unclever teenagers clamoring around it in `American Beauty.' No one could replace Stanley Kubrick and after the intitial tears I bought his boxed set and tried to make the best out of a bad situation. And it was then that I rediscovered his greatest achievement `A Clockwork Orange.'<br /><br />What inspired me to watch `A Clockwork Orange' all those years ago was initially it's `X' rating. I knew that mom would have a fit and I had to see why it was so provocative. For the better part of the 1970's it was also banned furthering my desire to see it. I was surprised by the `X' rating until I witnessed the hilarious in-out rape scenes and was somewhat amazed at the blatancy and sheer delight of the slow-motion pummeling of his droogies by the sweet looking but awfully scary Alex De Large (Malcolm McDowell). Upon further viewing a new love and passion grew for the film until I became part of the passionate cult that remains inspired by `A Clockwork Orange' more than any other films on the AFI Top 100 of all time list.<br /><br />`A Clockwork Orange' was a very sad film for any lawmaker who adores social order and loathes freedom of speech in 1971. The response of lawmakers who banned this critical statement on social order proved their fear by banning it almost immediately though it still managed an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture and Best Director and deservedly so. Ironically, Kubrick's most original piece was a witty and insightful adaptation of the terrific Anthony Burgess novel. I believe that Burgess would have loved what Kubrick did with it. There were subtle changes and Alex ultimately failed to become a do-gooder in the film but it was all for the best. You almost never like the movie more than the novel but this is a film where Kubrick works overtime to bring his imagination to the proceedings and the movie is better than the novel.<br /><br />With every Kubrick film comes the feeling of eating Turkish food. As a principle Turkish food can be presented with a taste that is somewhat unedible. More importantly is the idea of presentation and the experience requires elegance and an amazing contrast of color. This as opposed to taste makes for quality food. Similarly, Kubrick often shied away from telling a fundamentally coherent plot and concerned himself with the details of visual artistry. `A Clockwork Orange' was his best effort on the silver screen because he was able to finally incorporate a fantastic story with the elegant presentation of color, a task that surely kept him at night as he tossed and turned searching for a perfect balance of the two.<br /><br />What truly makes this adaptation of the Burgess novel a success, is what Malcolm McDowell brings to the screen. He is Alex De Large and you can't help but kind of adore his urgent needs for a little of the old ultra violence each night as he unexpectedly makes his house calls through the neighborhood and pounces on innocent women. You also can't help but appreciate his interaction with his good old mom and dad as a tiny snicker forms when he insists on not being able to attend school and a sad but sweet look of confusion and sadness innocently appears as his parents introduce him to their replacement son and he finds himself homeless and in need of his droogies. His interactions with his droogies are a delight as he goes from `singing in the rain' to a mad villain beating up the little groupies in slow-motion. There is a sense of sadness as he ironically goes from being Beethoven's number one fan to a botched suicide that leaves him with broken limbs abounding but the same clever smile and good attitude. The finale is quite possibly the best ever in cinema as sweet Alex cannot help but think of a little of the old in-out as the nurses attempt to curtail his ultra violent tendencies. The slow smile that appears on his innocently despicable face is a sheer delight. The incredible accent makes it all the better.<br /><br />`A Clockwork Orange' was a film that was so far ahead of it's time in 1971. The Kordova Milk Bar was a trendy little place we can only picture existing in the future. The fascinating way that his crime was dealt with could be the wave of the future should the capital punishment issue cause too much disagreement. In short, a little of the old ultra violence is what propelled this film to high rankings and what will eventually allow all of us to allow our children to see it, once their 18 of course.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />\n",

            "\"Wanted-Dead or Alive\" was a half hour western series appearing on CBS television for three seasons from 1958-1961. The series actually got its start as an episode of another popular TV series of the time, \"Trackdown\", during the second half of the '57-'58 TV season. \"Wanted-Dead or Alive\" starred Steve McQueen as bounty hunter Josh Randall in what was a very good start to an outstanding acting career in feature films. As played by McQueen, Josh Randall was the most laconic of a broad television landscape of would-be laconic western series heroes.<br /><br />Josh Randall carried a sawed-off 44/40 Winchester carbine (his \"Mare's Leg\", as he called it) on his hip instead of the traditional Colt 45 pistol. This of course played into the TV \"cool factor\" as his weapon made a much louder, more devastating sound when fired and of course had much more \"stopping power\" upon impact with the intended victim. Cool! Although \"Wanted-Dead or Alive\" was truly nothing out of the ordinary in terms of content or quality compared to other like fare of the period but Steve McQueen as Josh Randall and his unique weapon made this a \"must watch\" series. Only Paladin was better and \"cooler\" than Josh.\n",

            "The reason I gave this awful film a 4 instead of a 1 is the wonderful cinematography. This film is beautifully captured in its brilliant colors and wonderful landscapes. Unfortunately, the main character in this is practically unwatchable. The first time you notice that something is wrong is when we get our first closeup of our heroine. For living out in Gascony, France in the late 1600s, why is Valentine wear heavy eye-shadow, cheek blush, and bright lip stick? She does the best she can with the dialog she's given but ohhh, such dialog. Then, in a society that is 200 years away from Women's Suffrage, she expects... DEMANDS... to be treated equally with the men without even proving herself. She even rudely bursts into the Musketeer Commander's office and demands to speak with him. He rightly should have thrown out anyone who tried that except the King. She takes it as an insult that he is not impressed with her. She doesn't try to hide her feminine side at all including having a tailor made, curve hugging Musketeer uniform. This would have worked out better if it was more a \"Connecticut Yankee\" type where a modern woman is sent back in time but her modern sensibilities are entirely out of place in this film. I'm not sure why a great talent like Michael York agreed to appear in this travesty but I guess a paycheck is a paycheck. If you want to watch a film where a woman takes on a man's world, try Disney's Mulan. The story and acting are much better.\n",

            "Taxidermia is the goriest, most disturbing and most disgusting film I have ever seen, yet is one of the greatest feats in 21st century movie-making. It is dark and repugnant, but very deliberately so. It is not at all self-indulgent, although it might seem that at first glance. One cannot help but realize that all this gore is meant with purpose, that this sickening texture of coherence is what gives this satire its peculiar authenticity. L'art pour l'art gruesomeness really gets my goat, but in this case everything falls into its right place. Although I got physically sick watching it, I have to admit I am an admirer of Taxidermia.<br /><br />We see three generations of men from a strange family: an army orderly obsessed with one-sided sex, his son, an acclaimed speed-eater, and an animal preparator. They are all peculiarly abnormal in their own ways but so is everybody else in the twisted world Gyorgy Palfi has created. But we all know that however deviant a world is on screen it merely is a reflection of our even more deviant everyday life. What Palfi tries to put across is that in our society sick is not even sick any more, dementia is not dementia any more, and we are ready to accept any defect or corruption of mind as long as they serve the self right in his quest for creating something new, something with which he can stand out from the crowd even more. Search for the inner genius justifies everything.\n",

The English version is best for people who don't know Japanese. The type of anime that it is just makes it more entertaining to hear in English. It's a great show and yes the dub may not be 100% accurate or great but you can relate to the characters emotions when in English. The new DVD dub is kinda dry. I prefer the VHS dub which are more laid back and well the voices bring out the characters a lot better. The DVD was re-dubbed because a few seconds of episode 2 where nagisa gropes shuns younger brother were cut out in the dub but left in the sub VHS. This isn't a dirty anime or something.

All of the roles were well cast. The chemistry between all the main characters was great, making it a real feel good movie. I found myself wishing I could work in the sub shop with them. Jensen Ackles did very well, delivering his comic lines with his usual perfect timing. Some other reviewers here took offense at the nudity, which was not inconsiderable, but I thought it was all tasteful and part of the story. I hope this gets distributed - I'll be recommending it to all my friends.\n",

            "Eytan Fox, the talented Israeli director of the extraordinary film \"Walk on Water\" is a man who clearly has his feet well planted on the ground. His lyrical \"Yossi and Jagger\" proves he is man who can deal with a lot of controversial subjects in a realistic and convincing way.<br /><br />This brief film packs a lot for a 65 minutes feature, but in spite of its short length, what comes out of the story feels real and we don't begrudge the brevity in which it was presented. The story of Yossi and Jagger is presented without phony touches, that in the hands of another director, of worse yet, a Hollywood studio, would have been meaningless.<br /><br />This is the story about two men who happened to be in love and the consequences of something that goes terribly wrong that ends their involvement. The two central characters stay with the viewer for a long time, which says a lot about Mr. Fox and the way he has presented his tale about how fate intervenes in the lives of these young men.<br /><br />Ohad Knoller and Yehuda Levi give good performances as Yossi and Jagger. These actors make their characters work on the movie because of the intensity of their contribution to the film.<br /><br />Mr. Fox is to be congratulated for his inspired direction.\n",

            "This independent low budget drama gets good ratings for the characterization and plot. Even though it is a typical boxing movie cliché, there are enough twists to make it seem somewhat fresh and original.<br /><br />The story follows the adventurers of Dublin, a crooked boxing promoter who travels from town to town setting up underground fights and sometimes trying to fix them. He meets a female fighter, Katharine, who appears to be homeless but who can fight and defeat men twice her size. The two eventually team up, but Dublin's somewhat sleazy past catches up with them, causing conflict, pain, and emotional distress for both.<br /><br />I enjoy all types of fighting (the real kind) and consequently, I find myself being somewhat critical of film fight scenes, particularly when they involve obvious mismatches. The notion of a 135 lb woman fighting bare-knuckle with much larger, ostensibly experienced fighters and winning by KO consistently is just too much for me to willingly suspend my disbelief. The fight scenes are poorly shot, primarily because there are no stunt people and the principal actors do their own \"fighting.\" The fight theme and fight scenes are central to the film and they are just not well done. I realize that corners have to be cut somewhere in a limited budget film, but this was not the right place to do so.<br /><br />The ending was just too sappy for me and I was disappointed that the writer couldn't avoid the Hollywood style happiness and give us a real surprise for a change.<br /><br />If you enjoy the \"Underdog overcomes all obstacles\" type movie, then you may like this film, but I have to say I wasn't all that impressed.\n",

            "We have seen hundreds of portrayals of the horrors of the Holocaust. This bittersweet romantic piece however, does not revolve around it, but keeps a balance between a sensitively depicted threesome of one beautiful woman, a restaurateur and a pianist-composer and the historical background which influenced it and eventually sealed its fate. The film also creates a rather fictitious legend around how the infamously harrowing hit song Gloomy Sunday conceived and left its mark not only on music history but also on demography.<br /><br />Gloomy Sunday is a very intelligent piece, co-production of Germany and Hungary with the best assets of the two diverse cinematic visionaries combined. It is realistic yet playful, bitter but hope-inducing. A good cast and nicely composed pictures are an extra value. Very well done. Get your handkerchiefs ready. It surely will move you.\n",

            "I really like some of Mike Leigh's films - 'Nuts In May' and 'Abigail's Party' are classics. Sadly, although the themes of insightful portrayal into class-ridden British society are present, 'All Or Nothing' lacks any of the vitality or wit of the earlier films. As is well-documented, the film centres on the lives of three similar families living on a wretched council estate in London. The estate is a grim urban wasteland that could reasonably be mistaken for a run-down area of Poland. Their family relationships are broken and unhappy; their love lives abject failures; what work they do is soul-destroying and banal; sex is violent and dirty. Nothing ever relieves the misery, save the occasional wry laugh in the face of it all. And, as if the themes, setting and plot don't ram home the message hard enough, the film is soundtracked by a constant weeping of violins and woodwind. Be in no doubt: this film tells us to Pity The Working Classes. Yet this film is made by, marketed to, acted by and watched by middle class people. They only show this at arthouse cinemas. This film simply caricatures people in order to give the angst-ridden middle classes a chance to feel a little more authentic. Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols once sang of 'a cheap holiday in other people's misery'. That's what this film is.\n",

She could've easily been over-dramatic and cheesy, but she wasn't. Kudos. She must've learned something from 90210. The story should've been more about the relationship and the struggle to make it work and more sociology, but throwing the pregnancy and that movie director guy into it were just huge, uncreative cop-outs in telling the story.

            "Lies is a story of two people who have a sexual obsession. That is the whole plot, in a nutshell. They don't come together for any other reason than to have all out, straight up, kinky, beat-each-other-up sex and they're not pretending there is any other reason. They glory in it, they obsess about it, they talk about their last encounter and look forward to the next one. The best thing about it is the way it draws you in and makes you watch just to find out - where will all this end? To all the reviewers who complained about the grapehic sex, so, why did you watch it? You can't see five minutes of this movie without getting the idea, so what were you doing? Tied to your chair, maybe? Couldn't get free to turn it off? Held at gunpoint? What a bunch of hypocritical goober heads.<br /><br />Neither of the protagonists is particularly attractive, not in the conventional way, and I didn't feel that anything was shown for pornographic purposes (although that would have been OK with me). It is simply an account of an intense sexual relationship, where the whole reason for being together is kinky sex, and this idea is followed through the film. You may not have any sympathy with the characters, or like them, or even be able to empathize at all; but you have to watch because you just know it is going to get more intense, and it does.<br /><br />Each time J and Y come together, the sex gets more intense, more brutal, kinkier and nastier. They beat each other unmercifully, finding ever more severe objects to whale on each other with. Sounds kinda fun, doesn't it? The intent, though, is to show such a relationship and show how it develops, where it can go, and how it could happen. It even goes one better by making J an older man, an artist who is very class sensitive and somewhat tormented. Y is a schoolgirl, and her motives are never completely clear, as they probably wouldn't be to someone her age in this relationship.<br /><br />I would never have watched this except for the reviews complaining about the graphic sex and violence. That got my interest quick, but then I was sucked in by the plot. I just had to know where this was going and predicted some big blow up at the end. I thought that possibly one would kill the other during a beating, or their families would intervene. Either way, I had to know what happened, and that, to me, is the best part of this movie.\n",

Diana Rigg of the television show \"The Avengers\" delivers the only worthwhile performance and nobody else stands out in this lackluster but more accurate rendition of the classic yarn. The action starts with the Prince discovering the glass coffin with Snow White in it. Afterward, we learn that the mother of our heroine died after she gave birth and the dad married the Evil Queen. The Evil Queen wants to destroy Snow White because her mirror reminds her that she is the fairest of the fair and the Queen refuses to be upstaged. She orders a huntsman to take the young beauty into the woods and kill her. The Evil Queen demands that the Huntsman brings back the heart of the heroine so she can keep it in a box. Alas, the poor fellow does not have the nerve to do such a dastardly deed. Anyway, Snow White flees and winds up at the house of the seven dwarfs and becomes their housekeeper. She cooks their meals and keeps their home clean. Years pass and the Evil Queen learns from her mirror that the damsel has survived so she sets out to kill her by herself. Initially, she laces a bodice on Snow White and our heroine passes out and the Queen leaves. The dwarfs cut the bodice off and Snow White recovers. The Queen masquerades the second time as an Asian woman and gives Snow White a deadly comb. Again, the dwarfs saw the day. By now the dwarfs have warned the witless Snow White to not open the door and let anybody into their house. Finally, the Queen tries again and gives Snow White a poison apple. No, Snow White does not open the door but the Queen manages to get the apple to her and our heroine winds up unconscious on the floor again. Sarah Patterson of \"The Company of Wolves\" is pretty but she doesn't do much other than look pretty. Billy Barty, who parlayed his short stature into a film career, plays one of the dwarfs. Eventually, the Queen learns that Snow White survived the apple and is about to be married to a prince in an adjacent kingdom. The Queen shatters her own mirror and sets off to attend the wedding, not knowing that as each shard of the mirror falls to the ground that she grows even older and more ugly. Again, Diana Rigg is the only reason to watch writer& director Michael Berz's version of this story\n",

            "\"Reefer Madness\" (originally \"Tell Your Children\") was created to teach parents that it's never too early to scare the holy crap out of your kids. Through this film we learn that the soul-destroying effects of Marihuana (Mike Nelson explains in the commentary that this film was made before the invention of the letter J) far surpass those of cocaine or heroin. We see firsthand that even teens who can quote Shakespeare like nobody's business cannot escape its evils.<br /><br />Here are some of the symptoms of casual Marihuana use:<br /><br />- laughing maniacally while running people down in the street<br /><br />- playing the piano too fast<br /><br />- having sexual relations with people you don't really like that much<br /><br />- accidentally shooting people you do like pretty well<br /><br />- having no recollection of being framed for murder<br /><br />If your child has experienced any of these symptoms, he or she is a Marihuana addict. The solution is simple: force them to watch \"Reefer Madness\" because if we don't heed its warning, \"Reefer Madness 2\" will be coming to a theater near you or you... OR YOU!\n",

After reading the bad reviews here I thought \"it can't be that bad surely, it is at least watchable for novelty value... I like nordic films so from that perspective sure I can get something out of it...\". I wish I hadn't wasted my time. It is 100 mins of really badly scripted, utterly irrational nonsense about someone who the script writers can't decide how her emotions and actions should resemble each other, in a continuous manner with regards to the plot, and therefore ends up looking ridiculous and being forgettable. (Forgettable other than the fact I will continue to rue wasting 2 hrs of my life).<br /><br />There is just no point to this movie. And no I don't \"not get it\", but what's it about? A woman loves her husband? not overly deep. Human relationships? The weakest movie on this topic I have seen for quite a while. A history movie? The era and the plague don't come in to it at all other than excuses to make the ridiculous script lines excusable on the basis of something like \"it's set centuries ago, people talked crazily back then\". A middle-ages Odyssee? Stick with the ancient Greek one.<br /><br />I am just glad I can't speak Swedish (and had to read subtitles), when you listen to the talking you can just tell it would be even more embarrassing to listen to it proper than it would be reading the subtitles.\n",

            "Godzilla 2000 Millennium is the dark, but eerily beautiful updating of the Godzilla saga. It features stunning SPFX, passionate performances by a well assembled cast and great action. Takehiro Murata as Yuji Shinoda and Hiroshi Abe as Mutsuo Katagiri give inspired performances as men in opposite camps regarding Godzilla. In fact, the drama between the human characters is just as satisfying as the effects scenes- which are great. The score by Takayuki Hattori is moving and effective in conveying the various moods of this well-made kaiju eiga (Japanese monster movie). Godzilla 2000 Millennium also has moments of humor as well as scenes which give us insight into the lives of the people tracking Godzilla and who must then deal with an even greater threat. The scenes between the father/daughter team of Yuji and Io Shinoda who head the Godzilla Prediction Network (GPN) are entertaining and moving, especially at a very dramatic moment in the story. The monster battles are well done as are the confrontation between Godzilla and the Japanese Self Defense Forces. Godzilla 2000 Millennium also vindicates the traditional Japanese way of making giant monster movies. Made with a fraction of the budget for the American Godzilla movie of 1998, it delivers a more authentic, satisfying product. Godzilla 2000 Millennium is probably the second greatest movie in the entire series, exceeded only by the original \"Gojira.\"\n",

I wonder if Mr. Bray will pick this DVD up, watch it and laugh about all the bad stuff he and the rest of the cast had to wear. Great movie.

            "I only watched this film on MST3K so I could bare watching the whole thing, but watching it on that show didn't take my attention away from the film itself. I could still notice the sadness and the general rubbish of the movie. It looked more like a music video for a 80s rock band than a actual movie.<br /><br />There's a lot of bad points to this, such as the acting. It was boring, plain and it didn't make me react at all, just made me want to go to sleep more than anything. Also the acting of the mentally handicapped character was pretty unconvincing as well, and slightly offensive. I mean he was portrayed as somewhat of an idiot and someone who doesn't get anything, even the part when he was eating the dog food was completely wrong for the character he was supposed to play. It's not how it works and how the character should've been portrayed. I don't mean to make out that this movie is rubbish just because of this, it's rubbish for many reasons.<br /><br />The action was like watching paint dry, I just couldn't get into it because it was just so corn. The fighting scenes for one was very slow, it seemed like they were both scared of injuring each other when they were fighting, even though they were wearing god knows what inches thick. It's all staged of course, but you have to make it seem like it isn't, which wasn't very well pulled off here, that along with the other forms of action within this movie such as the bike riding and carnage etc.<br /><br />The only thing that was least unbearable about this movie was the theme. I mean an apocalyptic world is a good setting for a movie I've found with watching others such as Children of Men or The Matrix, but the difference between those movies and this one, is that they were very well written and everything about them was great and provoked the right reactions out of you when you watched them. But this, the only reason I didn't fall into a trance-like state was the fact I was watching it on MST3K, which is where it is only worth watching.<br /><br />In short, boring, corny and generally you'd just rather go to sleep than watch it.\n",

A lot of money has been spent on making it realistic and entertaining. Reminds you of the good old days when Van Damme and Seagal were backed by big budgets.<br /><br />Mercenary for Justice is a colorful film filled with explosive action scenes, great dialogues and one-liners, fight scenes in which Seagal actually takes part. It had been a while since I really saw him perform anything close to his Aikido moves. The balance between realism and utter irrealism is just perfect.<br /><br />You got to remind yourself that action movies are a genre in themselves. Lots of folks try to bring them down for various reasons...they just don't get the point. Just like romantic comedies and politic thrillers all follow some basic rules, action movies are also lead by a set of pre-requisites that you just expect to be there.

It was released two years after Richardson had died and it also features that other classical acting knight, Sir John Gielgud as well.<br /><br />It was a family joke that Richardson had married a butler to a member of the royal Danish house under similar circumstances. And here the old boy does it again. But apparently Richardson had a sense about these things. Because it turns out that visiting American Paul Nicholas is really falling for bride Susan Brooks and he's got a week to make his case before the real groom Jeremy Clyde returns.<br /><br />They must do things differently in the United Kingdom because I thought they would have had to have a license first. But that aside the young lovers, allegedly of college age and slightly over are all well into their thirties and even forties. They simply just didn't convince me as young people in love.<br /><br />John Gielgud was in the film as an Eighties era reverend bring the United Kingdom some of the Billy Graham school of evangelism. I'm not sure what his purpose in the film was other than to be with a valued colleague and friend for a last time.

            "This movie is a delightful surprise. We were invited to a sneak preview by our local newspaper. We had no idea in was a documentary as the movie began, we were immediately caught up in the drama of the story line. The stories portrayed were fascinating and well developed. I think the movie is classified as a documentary only because everything in it is a true account of events happening to real people. This movie is about the real people of America - the stars could be our next door neighbors as well as the icons we admire. It is inspiring to imagine that former president Clinton is sitting in his kitchen working on the same Times crossword puzzle that we are. I would nominate this movie for an academy award in the best picture category as well as in the best director category.\n",

            "With Mission Impossible like precision, Sean Connery, Lesley Anne Down, and Donald Sutherland pull off The First Great Train Robbery, years before Jesse James did it in the American West. <br /><br />Of course holding up a train with a dozen masked bandit confederates doesn't equal the near precision complexity that it took to steal gold bullion off a train by three men in stealth. Connery is the mastermind of the scheme and he plays Edward Pierce with the usual charm we've come to associate with Connery. <br /><br />It was interesting how Connery gets the idea for the heist in your typical Englishman's club with at least one of the responsible parties for the gold in that very room. The other club members know him as a retired industrialist who seems rather well fixed and comfortable. If they only knew the real source of his comfort.<br /><br />Lesley Anne Down may have given her career performance here as Connery's girl friend. Their scenes fairly crackle with witty repartee and sexual innuendo. Down is certainly not above using her sex to help in the robbery. In fact the first part of the plan which took about a year in preparation was to get duplicates of four keys that unlock the safe on the train where the bullion is transported. She compromises one of the key custodians in a Victorian bordello which is the film's humor highlight.<br /><br />Donald Sutherland is the safecracker friend of Connery's enlisted for the caper. He gets the dirtiest details of the caper. In fact the authorities get wind of some kind of plan in the works and Connery has to make some last minute adjustments to his plan. The adjustments call for Sutherland to get into the car in a coffin with a dead cat for odorous effect. What some won't do for money. Sutherland handles the whole thing quite well.<br /><br />Connery has the dangerous part of the caper which calls for him to go from front to back on a moving train. Those sequences according to the Films of Sean Connery were shot in Ireland which better represented the look of rural 1855 England. I was stunned to learn that Connery himself did the stunts. Sean admitted himself that it was the most dangerous business he ever undertook for any film. What some will do for the sake of art.<br /><br />The First Great Train Robbery is a stylish caper film set in Victorian Great Britain and the film really captures the look and manner of the period. One of Sean Connery's best films, definitely worth a look.\n",

Fired, the aged Miller finds it impossible to find a new job. When his money runs out, Miller is unable to support his ill, starving wife; desperate, he turns to crime.<br /><br />Director D.W.

McDowell was not old, but suggests it with some success.

That said, this one (for me) falls a tad below part 3, which I thought (and still do) is the best in the bunch. I will say that part 4 does offer up some funny stuff. The funniest scene to me is when Cindy and Brenda arrive at 'The Village'. They are hiding in the bushes and see 2 village girls about ready to walk right by them. They decide that they need to pull these girls into the bushes and beat them for their clothes so Cindy and Brenda don't look out of place. They do this, the bushes move around for a bit and, finally, 2 girls emerge from the bushes. But it's not Cindy and Brenda. It's the 2 village girls. When Cindy and Brenda do emerge into view, they are disheveled and a little tired out. Funny stuff. Though some jokes misfire, this is still better than part 2.\n",

            "James Cagney's blazing performance as gangster Tom Powers in THE PUBLIC ENEMY did not just 'flip the script' of screen acting in 1931. Cagney, in his breakout role, completely mauls the early talkies stand-and-deliver acting style. Spraying lead bullets from his mouth at every turn, Cagney blasts away the careful diction and rounded vowels that his colleagues were painstakingly trying to perfect and delivers his dialog any which way he feels. The energy in Cagney's performance is superlative-his performance would soon become the prototype for all gangster characterizations thereafter.<br /><br />Director William A. Wellman constructs the plot of THE PUBLIC ENEMY around the real-life bootlegging phenomenon that occurred after Prohibition was enforced. THE PUBLIC ENEMY takes it's place alongside LITTLE CAESAR and SCARFACE in a cycle of early 30's gangster-themed films that aimed to entertain and shock the filmgoing public with their social realism, whilst also sending a strong message that crime doesn't pay. Wellman's film serves as an accurate depiction of the era, effectively conveying the highs and lows of the gangster lifestyle.<br /><br />The film follows Powers' rise to the top of the crime ranks and eventual, yet inevitable, fall. Wellman opens the film with scenes from Powers' childhood in an attempt to discover how a promising young lad can grow up to be a vicious thug. The film is weakest in these early scenes, with slow pacing, average writing and rather poor acting from the children marring the production. However, once Cagney appears on screen in THE PUBLIC ENEMY the film really takes off. The audience is hooked on Cagney, watching him lie, cheat, steal and manhandle both men and women with relish.<br /><br />Jean Harlow shares top billing with Cagney, yet her role is rather small and does not really justify her name being above the title. Harlow, soon to become a part of film legend in films such as RED DUST and BOMBSHELL, shows a sniff of her star presence in a couple of scenes, yet is noticeably flat and oddly lethargic in her role as a gangster's moll. The script does not help, as Harlow has to deliver some truly terrible lines in her \"love scenes\" (!) with Cagney. Apart from struggling with an underwritten role, Harlow also seems to be far from the Platinum Blonde beauty that would define her screen \"look\". In some scenes she looks quite mannish, and on the whole is thoroughly unattractive as the female lead.<br /><br />The grapefruit scene with Cagney and the lovely, forgotten Mae Clarke is a much talked-about classic example of film misogyny. Cagney's mashing of a halve of the popular breakfast fruit into a wheedling, needy Clarke's face would both stun and titillate Depression-era audiences. The scene, amazingly played out to the sexy love-making sounds of Joan Blondell and her gangster boyfriend in the adjacent room, would help bring forward the enforcement of the Hayes Code in 1934 to restore morality in films. There is also, remarkably, a suggestion of Cagney being raped (!) by a hungry older woman. Yes, Pre-Code \"rough'n'raunchy was never better than in THE PUBLIC ENEMY! <br /><br />Also fascinating is the relationship between Cagney and his annoying, moralistic preachy brother. Is Wellman actually imploring us to root for Cagney after all in his juxtaposition of the brothers? Cagney's scenes with his Ma smack of the 'mother-fixation' later explored in his 1949 film WHITE HEAT.<br /><br />See THE PUBLIC ENEMY for a blazing Cagney performance! 9/10.\n",

Just like Series 7: The Contenders - which is brilliant, or House of Nine - which was still pretty good, you get a reality TV show based on people having to kill each other to win. Except this movie is crap. It relies too heavily on flashes of gore - which, to be honest, are not much - especially to justify the claims of sadistic gore - and little on any actual thought process. I'm not gonna go into details and post any spoilers - watching the movie itself will spoil any self respect you might have. All I will say is that Ed Furlong was ridiculous in Terminator 2; he was a complete douche bag in American History X - which means that he can only really go up.

He wants to go to Starthmore to learn art and launch his career, and arrives in the middle of a serial killer spree.<br /><br />His roommate is a hilarious typical wannabe-gangsta film maker who should have had lines after the first third of the film but didn't, and they bunk with a repressed homosexual fashion major used for good cheap laughs.<br /><br />Jerome falls for Audrey who appears to be a 28 year old who hangs around campus as a model without actually being a student or anything other than a once-lesbian b*tch.<br /><br />His rival is Jonas, a new student who looks like he should be at Boston College on a football scholarship about ten years ago.

Art imitates life, as they say. <br /><br />This is Kevin Smith's funniest and finest story.

            "\"Heavenly Body\", which was shown on cable recently, is one of those forgotten MGM comedies of the forties that had a lot style and showed a great promise based on the people involved. As directed by Alexander Hall, the movie capitalizes on the talented William Powell and the beautiful Hedy Lamarr, perhaps one of the most beautiful women in the movies of that era.<br /><br />The comedy seems to be a struggle between sciences that even though sound similar, are completely opposite. William Whitley is an astrologer married to the gorgeous Vicky. They appear happy together, that is, until Nancy Potter, a neighbor, interests her in astronomy. The good natured Vicky falls prey to horoscopes and charts that take her interest away from her husband, who has made an important discovery in a comet that will be crashing on the moon.<br /><br />Things get complicated when journalist LLoyd Hunter enters the picture and falls for Vicky. William feels neglected and wants to get Vicky to realize what's important and what's not, so he takes matters into his own hands and has a confrontation with the astronomer Ms. Sybill. Right after that, Vicky realizes how much William loves her and leaves all the predictions aside.<br /><br />William Powell was an actor with a lot of charm. He was wonderful playing comedies, as he shows here. It's easy to see how he would be good next to Ms. Lamarr, who shows good chemistry with her co-star. In supporting roles we see a lot of the best character actors of the time, James Craig, Spring Byington, Fay Banter, Henry O'Neill, among others. <br /><br />See the film as curiosity piece.\n",

A powerful and personal story of the little known amiable relationship between Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle during that dramatic home run race of 1961. The two sluggers were always pictured as being bitter rivals. This is a whole different tale.<br /><br />Mantle(Thomas Jane)being the Yankees 'golden boy' and Maris(Barry Pepper)the ridiculed interloper learned to coexist and become the M & M Boys. Mantle being jaded by the press offered his best advice to the often stoic and sullen Maris on matters of surviving publicity. Most of the home run chase was like a masterpiece on canvas. Maris never seemed to get the respect he deserved, but his fortitude garnered him a place in baseball history. 61* would of course become 61 and then later shattered and surpassed by another home run chase. <br /><br />This movie deserves being ranked among the elite of sports movies and one of the best baseball flicks ever. Pepper is outstanding as Maris. Jane takes a little warming up to as the Mick. A very talented supporting cast includes: Richard Masur, Bruce McGill & Christopher Bauer. Plus most impressive is Billy Crystal's daughter, Jennifer, playing Pat Maris.<br /><br />This is a must see for every sports fan!\n",

I can't imagine that these stagey productions would have met with the great lady's approval. Slow moving (especially when Tommy and Tuppence are on screen), and so lacking in dramatic tension that I am surprised more than a couple of episodes were ever screened.<br /><br />Francesca Annis is dreadfully OTT and arch. Her stage make-up makes her look like a doll or a clown in some sequences. James Warwick is very wooden and emotionless. Reece Dinsdale's comedy cockney is even more annoying.<br /><br />Tommy and Tuppence are totally unlikeable, and their laboured attempts at flirtation and humour fail at every attempt. Every witticism and remark in the script clunks to the floor under the deadly delivery of Annis and Warwick.<br /><br />There's a nice range of guest appearances from some actors who went on to great things (Anita Dobson as a maid who bites the dust after two minutes on screen), but the supporting roles are obviously less significant to the two leads. As a result, anyone who tries to bring a bit of life to things (Liz Smith and Joan Sanderson, for example) are shot down as soon as they appear on the same set as Tommy and Tuppence.<br /><br />The studio sets and studio lighting have aged very badly, and the whole production feels dated.\n",

So it was so very refreshing to see a movie that has the inspired spontaneity so common in Japanese cinema, but with a very British story. Shane Meadows uses characters from his own past as source material, and co-writer Paddy Considine (Richard) based part of the story on family history, so we have a film that has authentic characters and authentic, semi-improvised dialogue. The revenge thriller format has never seemed more sophisticated. Richard's calculated derangement is balanced by the thuggish banality displayed by his targets, whose crimes initially seem more like misdemeanors until the last act. This movie is well paced, laugh out loud funny, and darkly menacing as it proceeds inexorably to its grim conclusion. If only more British films were like this, we might even have a film industry. It shows that the only way to make good films in the UK is to do it behind the studio's backs!\n",

It's a very funny film that draws you completely into it. It's about real life, real happiness, and real people. No phonies here. This film will make you think about what life is really about. Watch it once and you will find yourself wanting to watch it over and over again. It's absolutely one of the best films I have seen\n",

            "I like when Dolph Lundgren direct Movies. I have seen several of Movies he directed and it shows his talent as an Actor and Director. The only problem with this Movie, the bad guy: Why do the Bad Guys always look so ugly? However, rather then Schwarznegger, Dolph Lundgren hasn't lost that touch of a Cool Action Dud He gets better the older he gets. Its funny, every time I see Lundgren on Screen its like reminds me, oh there must be something about Russia or so. Rather then Retrograde this Movie was a lot better. Retrograde was waste of his Talent. Its really cool to watch Lundgrens Movies and I know that there are some moments I think no this is not acting. This is himself.\n",

            "I'm always more curious to see the movies that are unanimously panned by critics and audiences alike, because half of the time I end up finding out that these movies aren't that bad. \"The Exorcist II\" is not one of those movies. It really is 180 degrees from its suspenseful predecessor. I've read reviews from critics that hated Richard Burton's performance, saying that he was awfully over-the-top. I actually feel that Burton's performance is one of the film's strong points. Despite the goofy plot, he maintains a straight face. And after reading that he was drunk during part of the shoot, it's pretty impressive that he can deliver such a convincing performance. The rest of the cast is good as well. Linda Blair looks cute as a button. But at nearly two hours, the movie goes on way too long. What else can I say? This movie is just plain dull! I stopped following the plot after a while, not because it got too complicated, but because I didn't care anymore. Let's just say that I just finished watching the movie a couple days ago, and it's already on sale on Amazon.com. That alone shows you how much I appreciate this movie. (3 out of 10)\n",

I could actually say the script word for word. \"Keep your shirt on, she's coming!\" Sandra was fun and exciting in this film. Her bubbling energy kept me laughing and glued to my seat. I recommend anyone to watch it for some innocent and old fashioned values. For example when Kim Novak was preparing dinner and she had salad and lemonade all sitting there before her family was home. Now, how many people have actually experienced that? It takes me to the time when life was innocent and we could use the word 'gay' to mean happy.\n",

Finally I could see it in the course of the Gay & Lesbian Film Festival in Frankfurt! I must say it was worth the wait...<br /><br />The first segment with Vanessa Redgrave shows the problems gays have, because there is no way to have a legalized partnership... they are talking about it, but we still don't have the rights every married couple has... it probably was the best segment of the whole movie! It showed in a very sensible way how a couple gets separated by death... and the heir takes the house and parts of the things they bought together, not thinking about that it might be hurting the widow. He just ignores the possibility that the two women had a deeper relationship than pure friendship. Isn't that the most common problem? Ignorance. It is great that a movie makes us aware of this.<br /><br />The second segment wasn't that good, but it was okay... the synopsis was you don't need to be a feminist to be a lesbian... we are all different, don't try to put us into categories... it won't work anyway! A member of a feministic group gets involved with a butch is avoided by her friend for it.<br /><br />The third & last segment was great, with a very sexy Sharon Stone and a wonderful funny Ellen DeGeneres. That love scene was marvellous! But it also showed what problems lesbians have, if they want to have children in a sensible way!<br /><br />The whole movie deals with the reality a lesbian faces every day... it is cleverly written, takes a bit of humor and a lot of actuality to give insights most people don't even think about!<br /><br />All in all it is a great movie, not only for lesbians... but also for people who want to understand the mysterious creature... the lesbian!\n",

            "XTRO II: THE SECOND ENCOUNTER is a truly dismal film. It is about as subtle as a thief in the night wearing a suit made of pots and pans. XTRO II is such a blatant rip-off of the ALIEN films (ALIENS mostly) that it becomes somewhat embarrassing. The pacing is just as bad. There is so much walking, searching and waiting for the \"alien\" that I fast-forwarded through much of the film. There's just nothing happening. The few times the creature decides to show up, I was extremely nonplussed. The downtime, and there is plenty, is occupied with washed up actors and soon to be washed up actors who deliver their lines based on dubious scientific precepts badly. It has been a long time since Jan Micheal Vincent has been on 'Airwolf', and has seemingly carved a niche for himself in bad science fiction and soft-core porn flicks.<br /><br />In conclusion, skip this film. Do anything else: learn another language, smash your toes with a claw hammer, watch the original ALIEN. Laying in an empty bathtub staring at the ceiling is more productive than actually viewing this film. I have not seen the first XTRO, nor have I seen XTRO 3 (!), nor do I plan to. How do films like this get made? And if given the chance, wouldn't most people make a better film? I don't know and I don't care. XTRO II is an abject waste of time. 1/10.\n",

The movie tells the story of Snapphanarna in Skåne (the southest \"state\" of Sweden\") and the war between Sweden and Denmark during the 17 th century when Skåne became a part of Sweden instead of Denmark. Snapphanarna was a \"movement\" amongst the citizens of Skåne that were against the swedes overtaking their land and on occasion forcing them to swear their oath to the Swedish king instead of the danish. Party brutal scenes, but probably not the way things happened back during the 17 th century.<br /><br />The word Snapphane was an insult word, snappa in English snatch, and was used as a word of abuse. There were different categories of Snapphanar, normally we count three different, highwaymen, free shooters working for the danish army and many of these were thieves and robbers.\n",

Because nothing actually happens!! The acting is fairly good but it's all wasted really as the poor actors have nothing to work with and just go round and around repeating themselves.

            "So, the story begins with an average couple, the unemployed musician husband, Brad(Rory Cochrane), is already up, making coffee and running a shower for his wife, Lexi(Mary McCormack). Soon after she leaves for work he hears reports on the radio of multiple explosions in Downtown LA. He tries calling his wife, no answer. So after a bit of walking about the house frantically,causing me to have a headache as the camera was all over the place, he gets in his car to attempt to reach her. He gets a burst tyre and turns into a garage, when he returns to his car the reports now say a dirty bomb was detonated. So he goes back in the garage and gets duct tape to ceil(sp?) the house, then returns home...giving up rather easily on the woman he supposedly loves.<br /><br />Once home an older Mexican man intrudes on the house and persuades Brad to let him stay. They Ciel the house after waiting a bit to see if Lexi will come home, but, oh dear! She comes home little after they've ceiled the house. Now, again, the woman Brad loves so much, comes home, coughing up blood, covered in smoke etc. Would you not let her in? even if it meant u maybe becoming infected? Considering you want to live and die with this person.<br /><br />Selfishly she breaks a window, he quickly covers it back up. Later the old Mexican man leaves, to be with his wife..Still Brad isolates his. Lexi goes wandering and sees a small boy, Timmy, who was earlier in the film.<br /><br />Lexi goes to the hospital with the kid, soldiers in contamination suits come to the house when she's gone and take a sample of ash from when Lexi broke the window. She returns, turned away from the hospitals, and then the two sit there, for a good ten/twenty minutes, talking. The men return and take Lexi away from the house...By this point i couldn't give a damn what happened to the characters, as the acting, story and general presentation of the film has failed to keep me interested or feel for the characters.<br /><br />The twist. The twist is something that wasn't really a twist, it was in all honesty, as the whole idea of the dirty bomb is to intoxicate all those who encounter it, which the bomb hasn't done. I won't say the twist, but by the time it happens, you won't even care.<br /><br />Bad story, good initial idea. Mediocre acting, uneventful script, and the camera work was just plain, amateur. I spent £7 to see this film, me and my two friends with whom I saw it with, were very disappointed. <br /><br />This may have been the worst film I have ever seen, it's certainly in the top 10 worst films.

This movie proves that a good theme, a sincere effort and some interesting, quirky characters can make even the most remote of subjects, a fascinating, moving documentary. Watching Jon Stewart, Bill Clinton and other famous people work at the crossword somehow humanizes them in a way that I have honestly never seen before. Everyone who attacks the puzzle is now on the same page, and the movie somehow made me feel a lot better about the human race.

The producers have taken great care to portrait the Legion properly. I was worried about the team mix as well (Saturn Girl, Lightning Lad, Braniac 5, Timber Wolf, Phantom Girl and Bouncing Boy ) but it worked and it was mixed enough with other Legion standards that there only seemed to be a static team in press releases only. The producers have done an amazing job at mixing and blending different era's of Legion lore into an extremely cohesive bond and there is enough small touches that long time legion fans can truly appreciate (such as the use of Interlac on display screens). My only real gripe is with Braniac 5 and his robot-like body....It's more suited towards Gears of the DnA era of the Legions history. But in the series it works. And with the season finale of Sundown and seeing all the members of the Legion I can't wait until next season.\n",

            "Betsy (the wonderful writer of this amazing film) personally asked me to write something because I had such great things to say about this film to her on Myspace. I could definitely not refuse her because I want everyone to know what I think of this film. I just want to say I came all the way from Florida to Los Angeles California to see this film. I was originally going to come to the Newport Beach one but I hadn't been able to because the airline ticket prices went up way too high at the last minute for me to go and I was so disappointed I couldn't go. Especially when I found out Danneel, Jensen, and Elizabeth were there, also and I adore all 3 of them.<br /><br />On to the film itself what a wonderful plot, it was so touching and heartwarming. It really made me go through so many emotions while watching, I laughed, I almost cried (which is a hard feat to conquer in and of itself), and I left with that warm and fuzzy feeling, and wanting to see it again right after.<br /><br />This is something that doesn't happen for me much anymore when I go to the movie. I find myself usually critiquing it to death, and realizing how unrealistic it is but this one I really could identify with, and I believe anyone at any age can.<br /><br />Those feelings of insecurities that everyone goes through sometime in their life, and feeling that their not good enough, but having loved ones be there for you when you need them the most and telling you that you are. I think that's something that everyone goes through, and that's what the heart of this film really is about.<br /><br />I can't really write enough words saying how absolutely amazing and awesome the cast is for this film. You could really feel the camaraderie that all of them had with each other, from what I've heard and seen it is on and off camera. I saw Elizabeth, Danneel, and Clea in the audience and they all got along wonderfully and then saw Elizabeth and Jensen at Comic Con and they also seemed to be very close. The way they hugged each other and laughed and talked to each other is something I can't say you see or hear about with most casts in films. Once they leave that set they probably won't interact again, but I don't think this is the case with them and that makes me love the film even more than I already could.<br /><br />I also have to say this really shows off the casts acting skills. Priestly was a great lovable character and was definitely a role that was different for Ackles and he easily brought across that seamlessly to the screen. Everyone around me genuinely laughed and clapped and cheered something I also don't see much in movies and a lot of that was when the Priestly character was on screen.<br /><br />I also want to say I didn't know that much about Elizabeth Harnois previously. I had seen her briefly on One Tree Hill and liked her on there, and also found out she was Alice whom I really loved as a little girl when I watched the Disney Channel but didn't really know exactly what to expect until the movie. Let me tell you she definitely exceeded my expectations as Piper. That storyline really touched me with her looking for her daughter, and coming to the shop and everyone taking her in and befriending her so easily. It was so nice to see, and I definitely want to see Elizabeth in more things to come, not to mention she is an incredibly beautiful actress.<br /><br />I also feel the same way about Danneel Harris I thought she definitely played the character of Tish wonderfully, especially considering I had a good 5 min chat with her and she is absolutely nothing like that. Such a humble, sweet, nice individual. These are the kind of people I like to see making it in Hollywood and I really want to see them go far in their film careers and hopefully they will get noticed for this film. It would be an absolute shame that not everyone can see this movie! It needs to be released in theaters. I would probably go see it at least 2 or 3 times more just in the theater and of course buy it on DVD.<br /><br />I hope by my writing this some production company will see this and take notice. I know so many people who want to see this movie and are desperate for it to be released. I've told some of them to come by and make that known too because there is definitely a market for this movie.<br /><br />Best Regards, Liz Bodie Florida USA\n",

            "In 2003, Adam Armus and Kay Foster tried to develop an entirely new version of MYSTERIOUS ISLAND as a three hour Hallmark telefilm premiered on September 10, 2005. However, the Armus-Foster concept was entirely too dependent on the 1961 version, and other clichés of the 1990s, to provide a fresh framework.<br /><br />The screenwriters, noting the vast scope of the novel, and the fact that Nemo only appeared briefly in the end, decided to eliminate \"the secret of the island\" from the outset to provide continuous interaction between Nemo and the castaways. As well, Armus and Foster sought to bypass the more mundane episodes of survival and developing a life on the island, to add more action.<br /><br />Nemo and the castaways clash from the outside, eventually existing separately on the island, until the final crisis of the pirates and the eruption bring them together. As a result, there are two rival groups of inhabitants of the island, enacted and told in different form, On one level is Patrick Stewart as Nemo, with Roy Marsden as his assistant, with whom he has almost a brotherly relationship, both enacted with professionalism and conviction. As in the 1974 version, Nemo's major role, and his motivations and loyalties, are as Verne presented, although his nationality is changed to an Englishman who has adopted India, given the casting of Stewart.<br /><br />Ironically, while in 2002, THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMAN finally cast an Indian as Nemo, but changed his motivation to a \"pirate,\" here he returns to the James Mason-Herbert Lom European style of casting, but retaining his actual beliefs, if not his ethnicity. Given a choice, I prefer Stewart's configuration and enactment of the role to the others more recent.<br /><br />By contrast, the larger story of the castaways is enacted in an entirely perfunctory manner by lesser talents, in a narrative that offers little opportunity for more than minimal characterization. The balloon escape brings together a slightly different group of castaways than Verne imagined. For the first time, in a Hollywood version of MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, Cyrus is correctly surnamed Smith, and Pencroff (not, as in the Cyrus Harding translations, Pencroft) becomes a Confederate Colonel desirous of the gold the pirates seek, as played by Kyle MacLachlan and Jason Durr, respectively. Spillet is here given the name Jane (Gabrielle Anwar), a nurse in the Confederate prison, instead of the war correspondent, and Harbart is replaced by her daughter, Helen, Danielle Calvert. She is saved from a giant bird (a la Les Enfants du Capitaine Grant) by Atherton (Chris Larkin) in place of Ayrton. Marooned on the island 8 years, he is here the brother of Bob Harvey (Vinnie Jones). Omar Gooding is Neb, rather in a more modern and assertive vein than the novel's characterization.<br /><br />The tale itself is like a serial, dependant on repetitious thrills to fill the running time. Filmed in Krabi, Thailand, over 61 days, in 2004, the tropical island is inhabited with more of the giant creatures that were the highlight of the 1961 version, so many that here they become the norm. Instead of sporadic threat, the giant bugs, rat, and bird appear in such a relentless pace that it destroys any novelty or surprise they might have. As a result, the suspense they provide is minimal under Russell Mulcahy's direction. The derivative nature of this device, despite the use of material from the Verne novel, classifies the 2005 version as more of a remake of the 1961 version rather than an original adaptation in its own right, a choice that diminishes the film's possibilities from the outset.<br /><br />The principal subplot, occupying even more of the film than Nemo, are the pirates. As told in an opening voice-over appearing during an aerial view of the island, Patrick Stewart tells how the island is uncharted but regularly visited, for men know that beyond the menacing creatures is a cursed treasure. One group of pirates provide the opening scene of the film, before cutting to the Confederate prison in Virginia. Later, Bob Harvey's pirates return to the island, providing a secondary source of danger. They, too, are menaced by the omnivorous creatures.<br /><br />Further clichés are presented as Nemo inhabits an island compound, to keep out the giant creatures, with an electrified fence, an idea unimaginatively redolent of JURASSIC PARK, and, to a lesser degree, H.G. Wells's The Island of Dr. Moreau. Only in the Indian design and architecture of Nemo's home amidst the caves is there some originality. The Nautilus itself again is rather too closely modeled on the one found in the 1961 version.<br /><br />A new element is added with Nemo seeking to end war by building a weapon so powerful that it could destroy a city. He hopes that this would dissuade humanity from armed struggle, but Cyrus refuses to assist him, saying instead every nation will want one. The secret ingredient of his bomb, found only on the island, is what makes the animals so abnormally large. Like the 1961 version, Nemo warns the castaways of the volcanic eruption, who escape in a small boat, while he remains behind to gather his notes, but is trapped in the grotto as the Nautilus is crushed in the rocks and lava.\n",

            "STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs <br /><br />One day,novelist and science lecturer Joe (Daniel Craig) takes his girlfriend Claire (Samantha Morton) out for a picnic in the beautiful English countryside.He has an ulterior motive-he means to propose to her.But then,suddenly and completely without warning,their lives are changed irrevocably forever when a red hot air balloon falls from the sky and a desperate struggle ensues to save the people on board.A man is killed and Joe is plagued with feelings of guilt and failure for sometime after.After a while,he does his best to put the incident behind him and move on with his life.But there's one person for whom doing that obviously hasn't been so easy for-fellow rescuer Jed (Rhys Ifans) who begins obsessively following Joe everywhere,leading him down a nightmare path of fear and madness.<br /><br />All of the cast do exceptionally well.Craig crafts a perfect portrayal of a retiring English gent desperately ill-at-ease with the troubling situation in front of him.This is the making of a promising new English talent we are seeing here,following on from his success in the lead role in Layer Cake.Ifans,usually a comedic actor (sometimes even in films where the tone is pretty serious),here successfully starts to broaden his range with an impressively unhinged portrayal of a man unable to let go and desperately trying to make sense of the demons burning inside him.Supporting players Morton and Bill Nighy are also very good back up to these two actors who are shining their socks off.<br /><br />The film has an impressive use of the camera,with inventively flashy visuals here-and-there and still shots that skillfully add to the tension of the story.This is complimented with a clever use of soundtrack that further revs up the story some notches.<br /><br />Sometimes the story doesn't come together that well,and the plotting goes a bit wavey.Also,some of the dialogue and delivery can't help but feel a little uninspiring.But for the most part,Brit director Roger Michell has crafted a film that hangs together very well and proves to be very intriguing,as well as further high-lighting some fine British talent that deserves to go much further.***\n",

Sure it was long, but The Insider kept your attention for every second of the film. Russell Crowe, once again, is magnificent. I just can't get over what a great actor he is. Every character Russell plays he makes seem so real and I couldn't help to think that Russell was robbed out of the award for Best Actor at the Academy Awards. His Oscar win for the role of Maximus in Gladiator (for which he deserved all the way) makes up for it though. He absolutely amazes me. Not only is he SO CUTE (well, not in The Insider because he played a 53-year-old, but he looks cute in most of his other performances) but he is also an amazing actor. Al Pacino also gave an excellent performance. He too makes his characters seem real in every movie he is in. The cast for this movie was phenomenal. This movie kept you on the edge of your seat. I absolutely loved this movie. It's definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. For anyone who hasn't seen this movie, you have to go see it and I guarantee that you will thoroughly enjoy it. I give it a 10 out of 10.\n",

            "A group of sailors experience all sorts of events while on the SS Glencairn. John Wayne stars in this film as Ole, a Swedish sailor who has not seen his family in over 10 years. It was interesting seeing John Wayne in a movie where he is not a cowboy because that's what he is mostly know for. The festivities began when a group of Spanish women board the ship and bring fruit and smuggle rum for the sailors. This showed how lonely these sailors became while on board for such an extended period of time. The mood of the movie did change a few times. It changed once when the Spanish girls came on board and again when they finally reached land and were able to get drunk. The sailors began acting crazy and got drunk very quickly. The Spanish girls started resisting them and soon a riot broke out. Sailors began hitting each other and one sailor even took a broken rum bottle and stabbed a fellow sailor. You can easily tell how bored sailors become because of how they acted when the Spanish girls cam on board. The officers caught the Spanish girls bringing rum on the ship and did not pay them. The music plays a big role in setting the mood in the movie. The music has a lot of string instruments to give it a lonely slow paced feeling. When guys look out at sea, the music is slow and fairly depressing. One quote that caught my attention was when a sailor said, \"When a man goes out to sea, he should give up thinking about shoreLand don't want him no more.\" To me I think he was saying that there is no point feeling sad about not being able to be on land because there is nothing you can do to change where you are. Each sailor who survived had to wait just as long as the next man to reach land. This movie exhibits how life as a sailor could change. Two sailors, Smitty and Yank died while on board of Glencairn and Drisk died at the end when he was aboard Amindra and it got torpedoed. You feel bad for the lives they live because they go through the same routine for such a long time and they see the same people everyday without seeing their loved ones. To me, it would become really frustrating because I would get frustrated doing the same things and seeing the same people. The sailors show their boredom by looking for conflict. They have suspicion that Smitty is a spy and search through his belongings and tie him up. He was falsely accused after Drisk reads the letters he received and realizes he was wrong the entire time. Soon after a storm hits and kills Yank, an air attack takes the life of Smitty. It was strange how he died because he was on a row boat hanging on the side of the ship, and when he got shot, the tarp just covered him and nobody really knew when he died. During the air attack, the fighter planes dropped bombs that didn't hit the ship, but the machine guns did and took the life of Smitty. The way he dies all by himself was similar to the lonely feelings the sailors often felt. Ole, the Swedish sailor also expresses his loneliness when they arrive on land and he tells the woman at the bar about how he hasn't seen his family in almost 10 years. He was the only one out of the crew members that was going to board the Amindra ship. His drunk shipmates pulled him off the ship before it left, but again one man was left out of their crew after he was knocked unconscious. A sailor at the end of the movie read a headline in the newspaper that read \"AMINDRA TORPEDOED\" and so it ended another lonesome sailor died.\n",

Like most sentimental films, they sometimes annoyingly tug at your hart strings. <br /><br />However, \"sappy\" would not do this movie justice as an overall consensus of the film. The movie will hold your interest, and certainly does contain more than one dimension to the story-line, and most importantly to the characters. Besides the romance that is brewing between McRaney and Judd, the film also conveys the importance of music in our lives, and does a proper job in expressing its virtues. More importantly the film makers for \"A Holiday Romance\" point out how instrumental a single individual can become in our lives, especially to children.<br /><br />Also, an extremely nice inclusion, is the much loved Andy Griffith as McRaneys Father.<br /><br />By-the-way, Naomi Judd looks absolutely great in this film, you would never guess that she is two years McRaney's senior.\n",

            "Got to see FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO recently; saw it last about 20 years ago. The same thing that I'd forgotten bothered me then came back to bother me once more: I simply could not get past the fact that Franchot Tone's accent was never taken into account by the German characters in the story. Of a sudden, Tone, a British Armoured sergeant (with a \"suspect\" British accent), adopts the identity of the spy Davos, with no noticeable change of accent. Nor does Wilder, the film's director, account for the nationality of Davos. Is Davos multilingual? Are we to assume he's addressing Rommel in German? English? French? This inexplicable glitch compromises the verisimilitude of the entire film and strains the viewer's credulity. As a result, I could not enjoy other elements of the film to the fullest, despite a charming performance by Akim Tamiroff. Furthermore, Von Stroheim is totally miscast as Rommel who, by all accounts, was a svelte, elegant, and heroic figure, not a vainglorious, pompous, and porcine caricature.\n",

            "Bette Davis stars as Julie, a Southern Belle in the Antebellum South. This movie predates the famed Gone With The Wind, and in many ways outdoes it--having more to offer--namely the incomparable Bette Davis. <br /><br />Julie is so much more than a pouting, prissy Southern Belle. She does what she wants when she wants. She doesn't care what others think about it--whether it's wearing a red dress to a ball while others consider that 'taboo' or sitting out on the porch with the slaves, singing spirituals. <br /><br />She was a feminist before there was feminist--a liberated woman before women's lib. She was to strong to be quiet and genteel. And her beauty lay in her strengths. <br /><br />Bette Davis does a remarkable job of portraying this character, going from a catty, to strong willed, to kind hearted and self-sacrificing. We see every facet of the brilliant diamond that is Julie through Davis' superb acting. <br /><br />The plot is gripping, and realistic--true to the historical nature of the Antebellum Era. But it specifically deals with one woman's struggle to redeem herself against a reputation as a \"Jezebel\" during an era where certain things were considered \"Taboo\" and improper for a young lady of the south. <br /><br />And yes...I cry at the end. But it's bittersweet tears.\n",

It belongs to an age where you had to make your own entertainment, when you only had Dixon of Dock Green on the black and white telly, while going to the movies to see a big colour film - and a woman get her kit off - was a real treat, real decadence.<br /><br />You rent these films for a bit of sauce and unPC fun - you don't really expect to be so bored by it all.

What a huge disappointment. Holly Hunter grunts and twangs like a deranged Daisy Mae, almost unintelligibly at times. Her accent is not at all mountain, but cartoonish. One could expect much more from an Academy Award winner.<br /><br />Also, it might come as a huge shock to some, but people in Kentucky and West Virginia have had electricity, running water, and indoor facilities for at least 50 years now. Not only that, but--hold onto your seat, now--most women there don't go around dressed like a Dorothea Lange photograph (and didn't in 1973, either!); nor do the children all go barefoot; nor does everyone live in rusted-out shacks.<br /><br />For a much more realistic picture of mine families, try \"October Sky\". The story is set earlier, in the 50's; but you can see that even then, people had more semblance of civilization that the dismal one-step-up-from-HeeHaw that \"Harlan County War\" portrays.<br /><br />A strange irony that this film, supposedly sympathetic to the plight of families suffering because of corporate greed, was shot in British Columbia during the film crew strike.

She is eager to start their home life together. All he can think of is seeing his mother.<br /><br />Louise Closser Hale is superb as the suffocating matriarch of his family. The other members, including Henry Travers and Margaret Hamilton, are very good as well. Especially fine is John Beal, as Montgomery's nephew. Indeed, he gives a heart-wrenching performance. It's possibly the best in this movie and he is working against very stiff competition.<br /><br />Montgomery is not only a mama's boy -- called Vicky by everyone, as his name is Victor. He is also a supreme narcissist: In one shocking scene, he inspects himself in a mirror over the mantel. Directly under the mirror is a plaster bust of him that Hayes has lovingly worked on sculpting. He doesn't even notice it.<br /><br />It's very hard to fault this movie. The ending is a trifle disappointing.

Montgomery, not generally a favorite of mine, is believable as her self-centered husband. Beal is absolutely superb in a very touching role. And Hale is subtle but compelling as the woman of iron who becomes an invalid the minute doing so will get what she wants from her offspring.\n",

Yes, there are some dykey-looking women about, as well as some pretty young female inmates just waiting to be sexually victimized by them. But it never happens. There's really no lesbianism whatsoever. Instead, it's the male warden and his guards doing all the dirty work. So why the women-in-prison setting?

            "The stars could all have performed the musical as written--the most accomplished, acidic, and cynical of Rodgers and Hart's output, thanks to a great book by John O'Hara, but Columbia just couldn't leave well enough alone, although it certainly didn't take away half the score and replace it with half-baked numbers by Roger Edens, like MGM did to \"On the Town.\" At least Columbia just subbed a few other R&H numbers that are always worth hearing.<br /><br />Sinatra was close to perfect for Joey Evans--although certainly no better than Gene Kelly would've been; both Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak were equally attractive, although since the only musical number that Rita has to put across is \"Zip,\" in an incredibly bowdlerized version (robbed of its intellectual heart) I wonder why her voice had to be dubbed. Would it have mattered if it weren't pretty?<br /><br />The fact that this show, one of the most downbeat of all Broadway productions, was turned into yet another sweetsie-poo Hollywood confection (and of course moved from Chi, of which it reeks, to San Francisco, of which it doesn't) is yet another tragedy in the history of taking Broadway musicals to Hollywood, which, with the notable exception of \"Oklahoma,\" just means that the show got butchered. It loses its edge about halfway through, when Joey starts being nice, Vera starts being nice, the puppy is nice, and everyone gets to live happily ever after--what a precious moment!!!<br /><br />Hollywood was better at making its own musicals--\"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Meet Me In St. Louis\"--are head and shoulders above any Broadway adaptation from MGM (whose musicals generally stink) and both Warner Bros and RKO, in the 1930's, make shows that put any of the \"spectaculars\" in the shade. One Fred and Ginger number is worth about 70 Marge and Gowers.<br /><br />Oddly enough, Columbia showed that it could do a pretty good job with an original musical--one with Rita and Fred Astaire that contains some great original songs by Jerome Kern and at least one terrific dance number with Fred and Rita, \"You Were Never Lovelier.\"<br /><br />What Columbia did to Rita shouldn't ever have happened. With the right handling, she would have been a truly immense star, rather than the pinup girl she was fated to be at the studio most famous for the three stooges.\n",

            "The only reason I did not give this a 1 is because I'm sure the bottom end of the target audience, kids up to maybe 5 years old, will like it. However, this movie was truly horrible. I think the problem rests on the poor acting of the children/young adults and the script. I'm 99% certain the script writers were told \"we want to do a movie where there is a hotel for dogs, make it work somehow.\" Spoilers follow, none of much consequence. The opening of the movie, with two white kids in a foster home ripping off a store owner with a box containing a rock instead of a cell phone because they want to buy some burgers for their dog, is the first blow to the movie's credibility. What kind of morals does that teach, first of all? Also, these kids look way too healthy, happy, and affluent to warrant stealing for petty money. So they don't like the dinner their foster mom makes them, so their dog is a stray after 3 years because these kids are irresponsible, so what? The acting is incredibly bad, the characters about as stereotypical as possible - It's Nickelodeon, what else should we expect? If they had worse foster parents, or at least demonstrated being more distraught and emotionally damaged from their parents dying, I'd forgive the stupid stealing bit. The kids act like snobby self-righteous brats throughout the entire film. It basically teaches kids that you can act however you want if you think your mom and dad don't pay enough attention and cook like crap, and that even if you are perfectly well off it is fine to break the law for petty cash.<br /><br />If you are a dog lover, and a serious one (moderate dog lovers won't love the dogs enough to get past story and acting flaws), then you may enjoy the bits where the dogs act cute. Other than that, I had perfectly acceptable expectations of a KID'S movie about dogs, and they were clearly far too high... If the kids are old enough to see this by themselves, they won't like this movie. If you're stuck taking them, see a movie in a different theater. If they're too young to be unsupervised in front of a screen for an hour and forty minutes, get a dog lover friend to take them.\n",

            "Winter, spring, summer, fall...and winter. No, this is not the quasi-eponymous Korean movie. It is the period of time over which the film was shot, around 2002. It is a documentary on the Grande Chartreuse cloister situated in a deep valley above the city of Grenoble, France. A couple of dozen monks live there. There are novices on probation and seniors long having made their vow of permanent ascetic life. The rhythm of their daily cloistered routines is the backbone of the film: frequent prayers, meals eaten alone in individual private apartments, execution of assigned chores, etc. From Monday to Saturday few words are exchanged. The only sounds are those of human movement, work activities, church bells and chirps from the surrounding forest. The only music to be heard is that of liturgical evening chants.<br /><br />Not every aspect of monastic life is covered. As the director explains, this is not an informational film. It is a long contemplation on ascetic life. It may seem too long after two hours. The tedious repetitiveness is purposeful however. Even on-the-screen quotes are shown multiple times throughout the movie accentuating that repetitiveness. It is enough to convince us that it takes a special individual to commit to such constrained existence, one modulated only by the moods of the seasons. We are presented with snapshots of odd moments: monks frolicking in the snow; preparing a vegetable garden for spring seeding; a summer Sunday outing when monks are free to socialize and, on this day, they discuss the appropriateness of washing one's hands before meals (a contrarian monk has a simple solution: don't get your hands dirty).<br /><br />Despite the isolation, there are signs the outside world is not too far. Fruits are served with supermarket produce number stickers still attached, correspondence and bills arrive and managed with a laptop computer (no evidence of an Internet connection), and some of the tools are distinctly modern.<br /><br />It's a quiet film.

What stayed with me after watching 162 minutes of this is the plain beauty of the cloister and the reminder of a life style that we may have thought extinct in the West.\n",

            "I have not seen this movie in 30 years, but I remember every scene as if it were yesterday, and the deep feelings that I had when I first saw it lingers on as well. THOSE are the marks of a truly memorable film.<br /><br />If a film like this were made today, even including a contemporary problem to replace the Cold War theme, it would go over the heads of a majority of the audience. Why? Because the movie-going public wants blow-em-up action to go along with any plot. Except for the cities that the twin terrors Colossus-Guardian nuke (almost off camera), this has none. Secondly, this is a thinking-person's movie that goes beyond the typical \"Machines take over the world\" theme that we've seen in the Terminator series and the Matrix series.<br /><br />What makes this move work on so many levels is that it taps into our greatest fears -- one of which is NOT death, but the loss of control over our lives. Why are people afraid to fly when their chances of being killed in an auto crash are so many times greater? Loss of control.<br /><br />These supercomputers were designed to act in the place of humans by making human-like decisions such as \"Kill or be killed\" and \"Offense makes the best defense.\" Unlike other machines vs. humans, in this movie, the computers do not fear humans, or even dislike them. Even when they kill a few million, it is done without malice. It is pure logic, and that is what is also scary -- making decisions without regard to the value of a single, human life. To the computer, deaths are just statistics, and in the \"Mutually-Assured-Destruction\" mentality of the Cold War, the side who has the last man standing is declared the winner.<br /><br />Also, unlike contemporary movies, these two, big computing hulks do not become \"self-aware\" in any human sense. Nor do they go beyond the level of their individual programming. They are making decisions that they have been taught will make for a better world.<br /><br />There are no, \"Forbin as father and Colossus as son\" overtones here like those in \"I-Robot.\" If anything, Colossus becomes the authoritarian father-figure -- as in \"I know what is best for you\" -- perhaps mirroring Forbin's real father. This authoritarian father complex is what drives the computer's decisions.<br /><br />It does not take a great leap of consciousness for Colossus/Guardian to know that threats alone do not work with children. There has to be logical consequences for their misbehavior also -- which are horrible to even think about in the human mind, but in the computer mind, it is \"Necessary\" for the good of all concerned.<br /><br />How many human leaders/despots have followed that logic? Too many to count.\n",

            "Herzog's grandiose manner, sense of the operatic, and true historical events come together awe-inspiringly in this apocalyptic vision of oil fires and destruction left in the wake of the Gulf War.<br /><br />If ever a man was fitted to undertake the portrayal of destruction on such a grand scale, then Herzog is he. It would be interesting to know whether this documentary was a commission or Hertzog directed this film on a personal, artistic basis. Whatever the reason for its production, Lessons of Darkness (it's English title) is a stunning piece of work. The Kuwaiti landscape is presented in sweeping, wide angle shots making it look like the surface of an alien planet rather than the Middle East. Huge oil fires, the cratered burnt desert, dark oil spills, crumpled and abandoned machinery and war vehicles, appear in surreal and awesome parade which both take the viewer's breath away in their beauty and shock through the utter devastation.<br /><br />A central section, in which quiet footsteps walk alongside a ghastly display of torture implements, provides a shocking contrast to the images that open the film. Here the impact is smaller, more intimate but as moving.<br /><br />In the third and last part of the film, firefighters attempt to douse the oil blazes, their hoses and equipment rearing up and out in the smoke and sunshine, shining like monsters in the alien landscape.<br /><br />The sonorous music of Wagner perfectly complements a vision which is an entirely characteristic, memorable addition to Herzog's oeuvre.\n",

In addition, her mom's continuously on the charity circuit, so she's never around for those heart-to-heart talks that young women need. So, left to her own devices, she has a gang of other females in need of thrills who rob gas stations and rape young men.<br /><br />While this tragedy is at times overly done, the point is still well made that parents need to be involved in their children's lives.

Yeah, you might cry, but rightfully. \"Mask\" is an excellent story. Rocky is a teenager who is very horribly disfigured. But he keeps his spirits up and just wants to fit in with the rest of the world. Cher plays his mother who is a biker chick. She loves him to death. And Rocky makes wonderful friends on the way through his life. It's a wonderful movie. I thought the story was very good and the actors were great.

            "Oh well. Talk about trying to be \"Walkabout\" and \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" and completely failing. Sure, the script must have been good reading, so you would think with the right director and the right film crew this would turn out to be OK, but no, this is what you call poorly executed and poorly conceived. I do understand what it was trying to say, but I just think that the whole of the first half should've been done with much more attention to the detail of the characters' feelings and dug deeper into their emotions further. I think the director has good intentions but did not quite deliver on this part. The film should've been called \"Australian Story\" to make more sense of the lopsided and biased view of what the Aussies perceive to be the strange cultural behaviour of the Japanese - after all, the whole film depends upon a Western view of the woman looking at this strange man from the Far East who seem to have no cause or reason to be wandering about the Outback other than the fact that he can. Whether the last third of the film explains his reasons for being there or not, the film should've focused much more on what she needs, what she is experiencing and should've explained a lot more of her backstory of who she is as an Aussie geologist, rather than let them both be strangely stranded \"tourists\" who are seeking for some sort of direction from the plot!!! The performances were stilted and without much heart, Collette looked like she was just sort of skimming through all of her scenes and dialogue as if she was rather not bothered about being in this film. Tsunashima did his best to behave like the Japanese caricature that the filmmaker wanted, and of course same goes for the wife and the whole setup in the last third of the film. At the end, I wandered why they bothered to make this film at all, as it probably reads much better than it does as a film. Perhaps if another, more accomplished artist's hands had got hold of it, the film would've turned out to be an interesting film in character study, but the photography is bland, the music is typically \"American Beauty\" ripped and tinny, and the direction and editing are completely unimaginative. They could've done so much with some truly spaced-out scenes of desperation in the dessert, but somehow everything is conveniently moved along and that only leaves the viewer scratching their heads wandering why they bothered at all. The film tries to drive some meaning into the reasons for these two to be out there in the wild for emptiness in significance of their own lives, but the cultural complications are brushed aside because the filmmakers do not quite get why there is any of that sort of experience in the first place for these characters who should not have had any need to spend any time out there at all. For Collette's character to give in to his demands so easily after having said her piece about not going out there, and then to complain about what he did to them out there, and then not to explain why she even has this job and what it really means - might have been a much more interesting film if the Japanese guy had to find his own way around, and had met a strange woman in the desert with whom he plays, instead of having this geologist lead the way. Poor poor effort.\n",

            "This series was one of the BEST of its time. I was SHOCKED when it did not continue to run in 1981. It was witty. Jeff Goldblum was the 'perfect' actor for the character of a nerdy stock-broker-turned-Mickey-Spillane-wannabe detective, paired up with Ben Vereen who portrayed the role of con-man-extraordinaire that mimicked the roles of a vast array of characters... in order to close their cases. I especially enjoyed listening to Jeff Goldblum's voice (In the background) as he would sit and read the Mickey Spillane book as he sat at his desk. It was 'pure genius' for the producers to include the book-reading episodes into the script. The plots and 'action' were believable and fun-oriented. In other words, it was a CRIME for this series to end so quickly. Now that DVD's of old movies and TV series are available, I have waited... and waited... and WAITED for Ten Speed and Brown Shoe to be released on DVD.

            "Wow--this is one strange and inspired comedy that is so unlike any other I can think of! Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn play aging childhood friends who grow to absolutely hate each other. Both are shallow and vain and both feel 100% in the right for hating the other. The awfulness of their relationship culminates in Meryl stealing away Goldie's husband--just because she COULD! Years pass and Meryl is a fabulously wealthy actress--who STILL down deep is vain and self-centered. Back comes the previously fat and unattractive Goldie but instead, she is thin and looks even younger than she looked decades ago! It looks as if she went to the greatest plastic surgeons in the world and said \"here's a million bucks--gimme the works!!\". Goldie is back to rub in her good looks and also to steal back wayward hubby Bruce Willis--not because she even wants him but because she CAN! Well, Meryl is worried about losing her man but she's much more upset because Goldie looks so much better than her! So worried that she goes to a strange witch-like lady (Isabella Rosselini) who tells her she has a magic substance that can give her eternal youth!! Despite the cost, the vain lady gladly pays and drinks the formula--and immediately feels the wonderful effects.<br /><br />When she arrives at home, there is Goldie and Bruce to finish their plan--which is to kill Meryl and leave! Well, here is where the movie and special effects get REALLY, REALLY weird. Meryl is shoved down the steps and obviously breaks her neck. Goldie and Bruce are celebrating as Meryl wakes up and is alive--but, her head is on completely backwards!! After a little adjustment, she's back to how she was and the formula was an apparent success! So then she attacks Goldie with a shotgun--blowing her across the room into a fountain. A few moments later, Goldie gets up and walks about with a huge hole in her body--so big you can see right through her!! It's now obvious that she, too, has used the formula! Well, after some more senseless punching and slapping, the fight is over--they really can't kill the other no matter how hard they try. Plus, for some inexplicable reason, they decide to bury the hatchet and become friends again. Now, their immediate goal is to use Bruce's expertise as a plastic surgeon to make them look better--spackling in the hole in Goldie and being ready in case they needed touching up! Bruce has had enough and they try to force his to take the formula and be their permanent fixer-upper! But, despite their efforts and those of the weird little group with the potions, he escapes and vows to never see them again nor use the formula.<br /><br />At this point, the film is wrapping up and the film ends with one of the funniest and visually impressive endings in film history. Instead of elaborating, you just need to see it for yourself.<br /><br />The film has terrific over-the-top performances by Goldie and Meryl and Bruce plays an appropriately creeped out guy who just wants to be left alone!! The script is fresh and funny and provides a lot of amazing laughs. On top of everything, the biggest star are the special effects--amazing and so important to the movie.\n",

            "While no match for the original Dracula by Tod Browning, Son of Dracula is, nonetheless, a much better film than its reputation suggests, and an improvement over the creaky Dracula's Daughter (a film that suffered of a bad case of \"comic relief-itis\", the terminal illness that killed off so many horror films of the era), which, while not totally without merit is mostly overrated. The problem with Son of Dracula is that it doesn't really feel like a Dracula movie. Dracula is a MacGuffin more than a character, and feels like a late addition to a non-Drac film (I guess I'm right, given that the working title for the movie was \"Destiny\"). And I really wish this was not a Dracula movie, as it would be better appreciated as a film, and we wouldn't have to see the untalented Lon Chaney Jr. as Dracula (only Carlos Villarías in the Spanish Drácula made a worse Count for Universal), who is pretty decent actually (better than as Larry Talbot), but that may be because he gets so little screen time. Anyway, I wish Bela Lugosi or John Carradine (who made an excellent Dracula but deserved better vehicles in the role) had played the part. In fact, this seems more like a Val Lewton production than part of the Universal cycle. Which is a good thing, actually, as that keeps the movie from being formula. Unlike the hacks that made most Universal sequels, Robert Siodmak was an excellent director and it shows here. The film is technically impeccable, moody, atmospheric and containing the very best visual effects of all the cycle. The transformation into fog is excellently done, and the scene where the hero shots through Dracula and kills his girlfriend (I'm not spoiling anything, it's in the trailer) is a classic moment to rival anything in the best movies of the cycle. Son of Dracula is not without faults, as it is somewhat slow in parts, but it's a very rewarding experience. Kudos to the Hungarian professor, who's more sympathetic than Edward Van Sloan's Van Helsing in the two previous films. And kudos to Curt Siodmak for keeping the comic relief to the minimum (just a couple of short bits with the black servants, not enough to ruin the movie). Forget if necessary that it's a Dracula movie and I promise it's worthwhile, and one of the best Universal monster movies (way better than the dreadful Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, from the same year and also penned by Curt Siodmak and starring Chaney Jr.). 7/10\n",

            "As an adult viewer, I had to think back and view the movie through the eyes of a teenager in order to appreciate it. And in doing so, I thoroughly enjoyed watching Camp. Some of the dialogue is awkward, and the story lines don't always wrap up quite neatly, or at least not ideally. But that's how life is, especially during the often awkward adolescent years, and the emotional realism is touching.<br /><br />Though it loses momentum at times, the movie never loses my interest because of it's strong characters, great musical numbers, and its fanciful--though a bit unrealistic--depiction of this teen-drama-summer camp world that I barely knew existed. And it's a particular world that most people have never experienced, but anybody who's ever felt awkward as a teenager can relate to this movie. Though never an aspiring actor or singer, I certainly related, and I enjoyed every minute of it.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure if Camp fits neatly into the musical genre, and I don't care. I do know that I couldn't even watch the first 10 minutes of the new Hairspray musical with John Travolta. It repulsed me. But I love Camp, (as I do Dancer in the Dark) which in my non-musical-expert opinion, has too much music-less dialogue, thankfully, to be considered a true musical. This favorable review of Camp is from someone who generally hates musicals.\n",

Bela Lugosi is always welcome, no matter how bad the movie may be, but the Martin and Lewis ripoff act, Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo, are nothing more than a glaring example of how show business devours its own. One has to sit through this travesty to believe it. Some side trivia: Martin and Lewis took Mitchell and Petrillo to court for stealing their act, but in court Mitchell stated that while Petrillo looking like Lewis was an act of God, Martin got a nose job to look more like Mitchell! And that comment ruined Dean and Jerry's case! Also, in the 1980s, when Lewis appeared on the Today show, they ran a montage of Jerry Lewis clips from The Colgate Comedy Hour, except one clip was of Sammy Petrillo and not Jerry! Lewis pointed out the error to flustered interviewer Bryant Gumbel. Jerry was not offended, though, he found the whole thing funny. \"I was never that good looking,\" he said.

            "...I managed to pack into a dozen scenes with the whole period of Nazi tyranny in a convincingly evil way.\" - Malcolm McDowell about his work in The Passage. <br /><br />When I saw The Passage back in 1981, in Moscow, I had no idea that it had been a big flop in the USA where it only lasted a week upon theatrical release, that it was considered a bad movie a failure. It would be much later that I recognized very famous and talented actors who were in the film, James Matson, Anthony Quinn, Christopher Lee, and Patricia Neal. The film was directed by J. Lee Thompson, the Oscar nominated director of highly successful The Guns of Navarone (1961). By the time I was watching The Passage at the theater, I had not seen Stanley Kubrick's A Clock Work Orange or notorious Caligula, and I did not know what Malcolm McDowell was capable of as a screen villain. I did know McDowell from the Lindsay Anderson's O Lucky Man that also had been released theatrically in Moscow several years prior The Passage. O lucky Man had left a deep impression on me and huge part of it was McDowell's performance as Mick Travis, the young naive man with the most charming smile who wanted to succeed in this world. Watching McDowell in The Passage playing the psychotic obsessed Nazi chasing the family of the anti-fascist scientist across the Pyrenees I was horrified and genuinely scared. Every time he would enter the screen, I felt physically sick anticipating some horror act to follow and McDowell never disappointed. I won't argue that the movie may not be a great or even a good one but I do remember McDowell's performance all too well, and I could not forget him in the movie for 28 years. Now, after I've seen so many movies and memorable performances, I realize that McDowell was over the top and judging by his own words, he knew it very well and did it on purpose: <br /><br />\"I played this real nasty Nazi who was chasing these people across the Pyrenees. We all knew real early on that the movie was not going to be any great work of art and so I was determined to have some fun with it. My attitude was that if I was going to play a Nazi, I was going to take it totally over the top and do it right. I ended up playing the character like a pantomime queen. What I was doing was so far out that James Mason turned to me one day and said, 'That's wonderful dear boy, but are you in our film? You seem to be doing something different from the rest of us'...\" <br /><br />If after so many years, one performance in a supposedly bad movie stands out and you can't get it out of your mind, and you remember the exact day when you saw that movie, who you saw it with and how you felt, for me it means that the movie was not bad at all.\n",

However, expect a double dose of the overworked situations of an authoritarian parent and the child who suffers. The Major General's story of White Christmas is split between two characters so that the movie works well as a separate tale. Only if you are familiar with the original would you get an inkling that the two stories are related. Gerald MacRaney does his usual strong character. Music is a plus if you like Christmas carols jazzed up a little. Naomi Judd does a credible job. Andy Griffith shows his Matlock image rather than the lighter Andy Griffith Show personification.\n",

            "Let's face it; in a world of computers and egotists so far absent of true human contact and chivalry, Audie Murphy will forever shine brightly and ever brighter as a true man. He is perhaps the last real genuine American hero, as we slip into a vortex world of lawyers, statistics, and scams.<br /><br />1.) At the age of 12, he chose to be a man by taking over his absentee father's role in his family; he literally fed his dirt poor family by putting meat on the table with a keen eye and a broken down .22 rifle. Working two jobs at this age, he still wrote cursively w/ excellent spelling and diction when he had to quit his education. This is something half of the high schoolers of today can't do as they \"rap\" themselves in hedonistic pursuits of clothes, breeding without responsibility, drugs, cell phones, and a disregard for another person's respect and rights.<br /><br />2.) After multiple attempts to join our country's armed forces, he became the most highly decorated soldier in our nation's history, with countless feats of heroism (please see WWW.AUDIEMURPHY.COM.).<br /><br />3.) He achieved Hollywood star status with his tough yet tender persona.<br /><br />In a current world of 50 cents, we can look back to a time when a man was truly a man, and that man was the United States Medal of Honor Winner: AUDIE MURPHY.\n",

            "When a group of alien agents from a dying planet come to Earth under the leadership of Isis (Amelia Cooke) to build a portal to connect both worlds, the warrior Rykker (Mark Dacascos) opposes and defends the earthlings. He rescues the teenager Julie (Emma Lahana), whose family was murdered by the invaders, and together they try to destroy the portal and avoid the invasion commanded by the cruel Saylon (Billy Zane).<br /><br />\"Alien Agent\" is an unoriginal and forgettable B-movie, with a terrible screenplay that begins the story like a sequel of a pilot of a TV show. The situations are only motive for car chases, explosions, shootings and stupid fights. The story begins with a car chase when two aliens fire their machine guns against Rykker but never hit the hero; suddenly one of them wisely jumps on Rykker car to struggle against the hero in a ridiculous sequence. The rest of the story follows the low standard. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"A Invasão\" (\"The Invasion\")\n",

            "*** CONTAINS SPOILERS *** The main character serves as the narrator in the Poe story. Unfortunately, in that short story, the character is a man; but, in this version of the story, the role is given to a young woman. She is a former lover of Roderick, instead of a childhood friend.<br /><br />Except for that one difference; and, a few modern contrivances (like the isolation tank), the story is incredibly faithful to the Poe story well, and the family curse is changed here too.<br /><br />But, more on that later.<br /><br />The role of the narrator is to act as an observer through which we see the story unfold. This helps us build empathy with the character, without all the messy foreshadowing and flashbacks that would have happened, had we seen the movie through Roderick's or Maddie's eyes.<br /><br />Given that perspective, I think the acting is very good; and, I think the casting was brilliant. Austin Nichols plays the role of Roderick to a tee  embodying the twisted perceptions, hyper-sensitivity (suffering from Neurasthenia), and photo sensitivity brilliantly. In the Roger Corman version; which I think is the definitive telling of the Poe story, Vincent Price never could have (nor should have) done as well.<br /><br />And, Izabella Miko is an absolute delight. Not just for the eyes, because there's plenty there to see; but, she also builds the suspense incredibly well as Jill Michaelson. As the events unfold around this young woman; and, as Roderick and Mrs. Thatcher (played brilliantly by Beth Grant) begin to manipulate her reality, she reacts honestly and credibly.<br /><br />The Usher family's secret is a curse indeed! As Jill said, \"They are all one line.\" Brother and sister as parents of the next line of twins and, all suffering the same family curse. However, the secret is revealed when Jill takes down the family pictures -- parents have twins and those twins have twins and those twins have twins... All you have to do is listen to the names as she reads them off.<br /><br />However, as Roderick's book unfolds with the movie, we find out that Jill is there as a surrogate for Maddie, who went insane because of the incest. And, Roderick and Thatcher are trying to keep her hidden; she's not dead at all! In this telling, she is trying to prevent the curse from going on - WOW, what a twist on Poe, with re-curring themes of being buried alive!<br /><br />OKAY, now watch the rest of the movie, because the last 15-to-20 minutes make it all worthwhile.\n",

One of the unique aspects of the Rough Riders was that the unit combined high society pretty boys, with rough, uneducated cowboys, and Indians. They throw in Black Jack Pershing and his Buffalo Soliders and it makes for a very interesting mix. Lots of good dialog. If you know who people like Crane, Remington, Pershing, and Hearst are it's even more enjoyable. Much of the parts dealing with Roosevelt seem to have come from the book \"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\". The battle itself is changed but but to good dramatic effect.

The situation of many Indians today living in reservations and being in a cycle of vandalism, alcohol and drug problems does not go unmentioned. But there is hope for many because the roots of them and the old stories are still there. So you melt into wonderful pictures and stories given from the grandfather to his grandson being on their way to a meeting of all nations. The intertwining of the genres(road movie, drama, tales) is very well made and John Fusco did another great job with the creation of the script. The actors have been well chosen and you feel that they are not just acting in a movie they are truly concerned and giving you their story. Behind all is a message not only for the Indians to again respect more their ancestry and live it but to the 'white people' as well.

            "I recently rented this game for the PlayStation 2, because it was around $70 and I wasn't sure whether I wanted to buy it. At first, it seemed a little dull and boring, but as the game progressed I got more interested in the game and so I kept playing. It took me about 5 hours to complete the story, and the overall the game is quite good, but after Spider-Man 2 (and, in particular, Ultimate Spider-Man) I was hoping for better.<br /><br />New York City is my first major complaint; the city is supposed to be bigger, but it felt small and unwelcoming. It was not very busy, and there were near to no noises in the background. Also, if you climb a tall skyscraper, the materials on the buildings further away disappeared, unlike Spider-Man 2. And it's not as accurate as the New York in Spider-Man 2, which wasn't entirely accurate, although this one is still a major disappointment compared to the SM2 one.<br /><br />Swinging around New York is as fun as ever, and the Web Zip is more powerful in this game than in the last game. This means that if you are in a hurry for a mission, it will be helpful to zip around instead of swinging, because the swinging is slow and even the booster (which arrives at the end of your swing as you launch through the air) doesn't help much. This aside, the swinging looks very cool, and is in the same sort of style as Ultimate Spider-Man, where he moves with the web.<br /><br />The story is roughly the same as the film's; Peter Parker/Spider-Man gets a black costume that makes him more powerful and aggressive. He tries to use his new powers the way he used to, but they take him over and so he must fight to control himself. Meanwhile, a new super villain, Sandman, is on the loose and it is up to Spider-Man to stop him. However, when the Black Suit gets to be too much power for Peter, he takes it off and it bonds with Eddie Brock, creating Venom.<br /><br />This story is changed before the fights with Sandman, and so the main movie fights are not until the very end and don't take very long to complete. This is disappointing, as Sandman and Venom were two of the super villains I was most looking forward to fighting, and yet the only fights with them are exactly the same as in the movie - and less! The other super villains are the Lizard (which is fun as long as you don't keep dying, because then it gets rather boring) and Morbius/Shriek. Morbius and Shriek take up most of the story and make you wonder if you're ever going to get to Sandman and Venom, and I got a little confused when I read on the box \"CHOOSE between 5 different story lines\". In the end, this was a false statement; you can only follow the game, not choose any story lines, and I was a bit worried at first that I had accidentally chosen the wrong one! Basically, the Morbius/Shriek part of the game is not very fun, and takes up a lot of time. The only reason you'll want to play it is to get to Venom and Sandman, although those fights aren't everything you'd hope them to be either. Venom looks incredibly fat and isn't appealing to the eye at all (despite the fact that he's not SUPPOSED to - see the movie to see what the game creators were trying to make). The fights with him are long and difficult, and his taunts get very annoying after the hundredth time (and he repeats them about 50 times in one fight, so you end up playing the level, dying, and then repeating the level, which equals more annoying taunts).<br /><br />The best parts of the game are the three Sandman fights, although even these are not all they're cracked up to be. Mostly you just repeat the same thing over and over again, and it doesn't seem very action-y.<br /><br />I did enjoy this game mildly, though; the graphics were okay, and the boss fights weren't all too bad. I haven't yet played Spider-Man 3 for PC (which is a port of the Xbox 360 and PS3 version) but I am sure it is better than the PS2 version. I can, in a way, recommend this game, but only for the Sandman battles.<br /><br />4/10.\n",

Although some interesting points are put across, such as the release one feels from using the word and it's traditional use with negativity and sexual encounters. Although most of the talking heads are speaking in defence of the word, a few conservatives put their point across and speak of defence of a society with standards and decency. It's short and is more than satisfactory as a documentary, but as it is even pointed out, c*nt is the word really likely to send shudders down the spine. Why wasn't a documentary made of that?

Nastassja Kinski plays a Wisconsin farm girl named Elizabeth who leaves home and runs away to New York.

Even with such a novel idea, it couldn't escape its roots that hang heavily in this old-hat haunted house format. No surprises or shocks here. The pallid story never grips or inserts much interest, as it becomes a wearisome tale of never-ending, suspicious tedium. The slow grinding pace doesn't help matters either. It seems to be all build up, but director George Bowers' predictable touch can't seem to raise much in the way of suspense and really overuses the usual scare tactics with miserable results. This even goes for Webster Lewis' generically telegraphed score. One or two effective surreal set-pieces (involving the hearse and its driver) and Mori Kawa's nicely atmospheric photography, just can't make-up for the lame, weak and overly boring presentation. Performances feel wooden and terribly uninterested, and it seems to show. Trish Van Devere fluffs about, and Joseph Cotton adds his two bobs worth. Put it under the very forgettable files.\n",

Her father is the one with the camera, filming the scene for a documentary on Japanese youths. Eventually it seems the father is letting himself be seduced, and she tells him the price. They have sex, the father is a preemie, and the disappointed daughter reacts by doubling the price. The father then realizes the camera has been on throughout.<br /><br />Then another title card appears: \"Have you ever been hit on the head?\" What follows is a single shot, the content of which one could reasonably guess based on the title of the scene.<br /><br />Among all the connecting vignettes, twisted and vomit-provoking as can be, there is one which very telling, but by this time, the viewer is so taken aback that finding significance in what one is seeing seems so bewildering. But the scene involves the father in one of his many frantic situations with his camera, running off to the camera about how he is supposed to feel. He doesn't know how. And neither do we.<br /><br />Miike is known for his go-for-broke gross-out violence, blood, guts and gore, not to mention all the perverse sexuality we tend to see in his countless films, and many of them he has churned out as simply as just a fun job. When asked why, for instance, in Dead or Alive, a character produces a bazooka from thin air, Miike laughed and said \"Why shouldn't he have a bazooka? Don't all guys fantasize about bazookas?\" With this direct-to-video shocker, the viewer realizes how aware he is of the effect of his content, and in so being, never indicates to us what we are supposed to feel. Most movies, most TV shows, certainly the news and most other forms of media output indicate through a basic film language what we are morally supposed to be feeling. Miike doesn't find this social phenomenon so easily done, and builds this $60,000 cult film around those aforementioned forms of media, exploiting the production's conception as an exercise in exploring the benefits of low-cost Digital Video to replicate documentary footage and home movies, which lathers the film with a sense of realism, which contrasts wildly with the freakishly bizarre scenes and pitch-black humor. He keeps this tense juxtaposition consistent and never allows us for a moment to sit back and relax, to shift into auto-pilot.<br /><br />As a result, watching Visitor Q becomes this grotesque experience throughout which we realize how unaccustomed we are to human perversions. Am I repulsed, exasperated, laughing, compassionate, overwrought and bewildered? I am never signaled. You're on your own. And consequently, I felt all of those things.\n",

            "This slimy creature-feature starts '80s teen hit C. Thomas Howell. Scientists have created genetically altered giant ants in a bizarre experiment which backfires terribly as the creatures go on a kill-crazy rampage. It turns into a world where giant insects run rampant. Survivors barricade themselves in a skyscraper in an attempt to avoid the roaming menace, but even that's no guarantee of safety. Its a little bloody, not gory enough for my taste though. A thoroughly entertaining B-movie; GLASS TRAP was directed by cult horror director Fred Olen Ray who also directed \"HOLLYWOOD CHAINSAW HOOKERS\" Another one of my favorites.\n",

            "Six months after I saw this movie I saw Chalte Chalte. Rumors had it that the two movies were similar. Yes the concept was similar yet the movies are completely different. This movie lies above Chalte Chalte. This movie is good at a pace. The biggest problem in the Chalte Chalte was it's pace. The storyline in this movie is just as good as Chalte Chalte, but direction is ten times better here. However, Chalte Chalte had terrible direction. This movie's direction is just above average. Reason being is no problem is being solved or for that matter started. Reasons why the marriage is falling apart are for immaturity of Vivek's character which was something Rani already hated from the beginning. However, the movie still is very good, and one wouldn't realize flaws unless you go deep into the movie like me. Rani Mukherjee is much more beautiful in the Chalte Chalte, yet gives a more charming performance here (looks aren't everything). Her husky voice works very well for her fight scenes. Vivek Oberoi is also good. He isn't the lover boy type though I have to give him credit for trying. While Chalte Chalte had more of a commercial film feeling, this movie is more like an art film. I am not a huge fan of art films, but don't get me wrong, that's just me. The songs were pretty good though I found them to be a little (not too much) overrated. Millions of people I know love the title song yet it didn't appeal to me. It's a pretty good song. My favorite song was Chori Pe Chori, and luckily the rap portions are kept to a minimum in the movie, otherwise I cringe every time I hear them on the soundtrack. It is a continuation of Sharara (with HOT Shamita Shetty), and sadly got unnoticed due to its dumb rap. Chalka Chalka Re is very nice song, and it's picturization works very well. Aye Udi Udi Udi is one of my favorite songs and there isn't much to say about its music video. O Humdum Soniyo Re could've been a good danced, but is just left to the background. Then Chupke Se is another good song while Naina Milake didn't appeal to me. To end this comment is that I will recommend to watch this movie, but you'll need to know the story.\n",

All in all, a first class production. I thought the director did a superb job giving enough location shots to make you swoon while allowing the actors do what they do so well. Plus the intrigue of wondering about the likelihood of all the events that transpired was provocative.

The brown and green colors add to the weirdness of this universe. <br /><br />Is it horror? Yes and no. Is it a comedy? Yes and no. Is it brilliant? Oh yes!<br /><br />Everybody involved in the making of this picture gave it its best. The camera work is brilliant, the sets are simply amazing (with the final bathroom scene at the pinnacle), the editing and pace is breathtaking.<br /><br />This could have been a very dark movie (and I guess a few Hollywood directors would have tried to turn it into a splatter movie and fail miserably), but the humor is just light, off-beat and hilarious enough to make it into a consistent and bearable whole. Every universe has its humor, and a strange universe has strange humor. Jacques Tati would have loved Delicatessen.<br /><br />Julie's 'tea ceremony' without her glasses, the mattress spring test, Aurore's failing suicide contraptions, it's all funny as hell.

The fact that the film takes itself so seriously is part of the enjoyment. Director Otto Preminger seems unaware that he's NOT making another LAURA. Still, Tierney is striking and her slightly off-kilter personality lends itself nicely to this type of role. She was always at her best playing women who may or may not be REAL BAD! Ferrer is his usually hammy self, but this time it works in his favor. How else should one play a hypnotist? Richard Conte is badly cast as Tierney's doctor husband. It might be the role --- he seems to be the dimmest doctor imaginable.\n",

            "Ahhh... There's nothing like the holiday season! Family reunions around the big table, presents for everybody and the kids playing all night long after Santa Claus' visit. Movies set in Christmas are always the kind of production which enhance our mood, touch us and make us feel better... Is it? <br /><br />Not anymore. Because \"Die Hard\" is set exclusively on Christmas Eve, but it has nothing to do with Santa, elves or Frosty the Snowman. It simply is the catalyst of the blockbuster generation of the 90s and it's also one of the best action movies of all time.<br /><br />The movie is about a group of European terrorists (they're German, actually) who plan to steal $600,000,000 from Nakatomi Plaza's vault, in Los Angeles. By the way, for those who didn't know it, the Nakatomi Plaza building is exactly the same than 20th Century Fox headquarters.<br /><br />The group is led by Hans Gruber, one of the most interesting villains portrayed for a while and Alan Rickman's best role to date. What distinguishes Gruber from the other master criminals is his great intelligence, his apparently high level of education and erudition and his careful plotting of the heist. He always seems to know what he is doing, what he has to do, what is gonna happen and what to do if there is any hitch. He looks like a modern Phileas Fogg. This is almost scary, because we can ask ourselves: \"How could we beat this... machine?\" <br /><br />Unfortunately for Gruber, there is only one little thing (and a considerable one) that he didn't count on: John McClane (the one and only Bruce Willis, in his breakthrough role). McClane is a NYPD cop who came to L.A. to visit his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), but he was able to escape himself from the terrorists when they invaded the building. Now, he's the only one able of defeating the terrorists and he's gonna have to use his brains, his guts and his muscles in order to stay alive and save everybody.<br /><br />McClane is first depicted as a mildly-reclusive, word-avid cop, but he quickly becomes wild after the terrorists' takeover. And his heroic actions throughout the entire movie make him one of the coolest heroes of the last years, along with Indiana Jones and James Bond.<br /><br />The action scenes are greatly orchestrated by action maestro John McTiernan (known at the time for \"Predator). Not only do they figure bloody battles, explosive gunfights and eye-popping pyrotechnic effects, but they're filmed in unique and interesting ways. Here are some examples: After Harry Ellis is shot, we can watch Gruber talking to the police via walkie-talkie... throughout holes made in Ellis' head. And there's also these scenes where McClane shoot two terrorists in the legs, making them literally blow out with blood.<br /><br />Gunfights are unrelenting and we could believe that there were as many bullets shot in this film as in an entire war.<br /><br />And for dessert, what about two great bombings inside the building itself? First, there is that unforgettable and visually-dazzling massive explosion made by McClane with a 'bomb chair' and, second, that epic roof bombing, which can be visible from the far other side of the city.<br /><br />This is the great part of the visual. The less shining part is the light circles and ovals which constantly appear and disappear during nearly all the movie. This is very annoying and disturbing.<br /><br />Other than Gruber and McClane, there are only two very interesting characters. The first one is Gruber's henchman Karl (Alexander Godunov). Just looking at him is dreadful. His eyes are aggressive, cold and piercing. And his indelible grimace render him menacing and serious. He's that kind of guy with whom it is preferable not to make angry.<br /><br />The other interesting protagonist is Sgt. Powell (Reginald VelJohnson). He's the only contact that McClane has with the exterior from inside his glass pseudo-prison. Together, they develop a close relationship with each other during the operation although they never see each other until the end, in a very heart-warming scene.<br /><br />\"Die Hard\" wins points for what it is and for what is has become. In 1988, it showed a whole new kind of action sub-genre: the die-hard genre, which is an action picture taking place in a restrained place, such as a skyscraper, a plane and so on... The hero was a real human being, instead of being a reckless soldier, a suave spy or a martial-arts expert. It is a great example of the near-perfect action picture. It's \"Die Hard\" that launched a wave of big-budget action pictures, making the 90s what we could call the 'yippee-ki-yay' generation.\n",

I personally have never been shown footage like that before for general viewing. I do agree as \"Ijapa in the states\" has stated that you are given an impression by the film that the RUF are responsible for the majority of the atrocities that happened in Sierra Leone.Having never lived there I would never be able to comment on this. I do however think that it is a documentary that the public should be made aware of at least as I knew very little regarding the problems that Sierra Leone have and think that this should be very much to the director and everyone involved's credit.\n",

(John Drew Barrymore), gets involved with his girlfriend Joan (Diane Jergens) and gets involved with selling drugs. But Tony may not be who he seems to be.<br /><br />At times funny but mostly boring teen flick. This throws reality out the window right at the beginning with Jerry Lee Lewis on the back of a truck (with a band no less) \"singing\" a tune and all the \"high school\" kids (they're easily all in their 20s) start dancing! The 50s slang is way out of date and makes most of the \"teenagers\" sound like a bunch of idiots. The story is predictable and the attempt to sell this as a serious drug movie are just laughable. And seriously--Russ Tamblyn as a tough kid?????? He's terrible but he's totally miscast and the dialogue does him no favors. Barrymore adopts a hysterically stupid Southern accent and Van Doren shows off her \"assets\" by wearing VERY tight shirts! Sterling and Jergens try to act but nobody could make this work. I suppose this might be fun for some people but I was mostly bored. Might be worth catching to see some of the actors so young and Michael Landon in a small role but the dull story, bad acting and real jaw-dropping vamping by Van Doren make this a chore to sit through.

            "The worst kinds of films are bad horror films. There are those you can enjoy, and laugh at, and there are those that make you want to gouge your eyes out. Take a good look at my rating and guess which kind this film is.<br /><br />The story? There is none. A killer is on the loose, that's all you need to know. The setting is more important: It's a summer camp, at night, filled with teenagers. Five minutes into the movie the murderer starts to off teenagers and doesn't stop until the end of the film. That's it. No story. No character development. No mystery. Just a bunch of scenes were people die for no apparent reason. It's the kind of film you make with your friends when you're bored.<br /><br />I like slasher films. They're good as no-brainer entertainment. They're never scary, but at least they kill time. This movie doesn't kill time, it kills you're braincells and drains your energy. It's so stupid you wouldn't believe it, and there is noway anyone could ever enjoy this film... Ever.<br /><br />The biggest mistake the director, or writer made, was probably to fill the film with clichés. But instead of using different ones, he uses the same one over and over again. A person goes missing. Another person goes to look for him, and is killed. So, another person goes looking and is killed. A third person goes looking, all alone, and not surprisingly, finds himself dead pretty soon. And that's how the film goes. I am not kidding.<br /><br />If you want to look up a good slasherfilm, try to find one that has something that resembles a plot. If you want a bad slasherfilm, don't rent this one. Because this isn't even a film. It's just a montage of people getting killed for no reason at all.\n",

An entity from outer space comes to our world and needs to enter human bodies in order to conquer it. A once respected scientist(Lee Van Cleef)has the ability to communicate with the invader and wants to be part of the super intellectual take over. His best friend (Peter Graves)is a rocket scientist that unknowingly provided the invader from Venus a way to arrive on earth.<br /><br />The movie of course poses a frightening event in an innocent time. Mr. Graves plays his role very calm with little emotion to speak of. The rest of the cast seems way over the top. The cast includes Beverly Garland, Russ Bender, Sally Fraser and Dick Miller.<br /><br />If the appearance of the monster was left to our imagination, it might have been more thrilling. But we get so disappointed without a creature of some sort to fuel our fears. It came and it conquered...well, conquered for almost an hour.\n",

            "*Spoilers* Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is brilliant criticism of the media obsession with violence. But this contention ignores the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could have shown his serial killers as vicious, inhuman murderers of innocent people and contrasted this with a morbid media fascination. Instead he lends them justification. The movie portrays just about every victim as someone who deserved to be hurt. Engaging in vicious stereotyping, Stone presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures - dumb rednecks, broken-English speaking immigrants, lazy fat people. The one person that the homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype. Of course they befriend the old, hallucinogen-using American-Indian - because they're trendy, dude? Let's make him an admirable character. Fat, Chinese clerks and \"hicks\" are uncool, so let's make it seem like the deserve to die. Instead of twisted,hateful that are corrupted by their misdeeds, their rampage makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are made sexy and cool and surreal visuals are bound to entice more impressionable people. Justice is mocked. The police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal, ugly and scowling compared to the GQ murderers. Again, this is not in the media reports within the film but in the \"reality\" in the film. There is no nuance or subtlety in the film - just overblown performances and visuals. The film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence. The proof that the film fails in its message lies in actual real world reactions to it. Some impressionable young people who saw this movie cited it as inspiration for murders that they committed. The film's \"message\" is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous real-life results. The clever message is nowhere to be seen.\n",

            "Having some Mexican-Indian blood in me, I've always been interested in what I could read about the Aztecs and Mayans and others. But never did I achieve as elaborate a vision in my head, try as I might, as Mel Gibson has with the beautiful Apocalypto. Is it accurate? I've more than just strong doubts in at least one case, but like all good fiction, it probably tells more truth, despite its inaccuracies, than a dozen scholarly tomes. The movie is engrossing and, even more difficult, plausible and quite evocative. I would have bet any amount of money that this movie was impossible to make. And though some have complained that the film's ending involves an historical inaccuracy, I think there was more than enough reason to put it in.<br /><br />There's a strong story that reminded me of other Third World folklore I've read, only better. In a lot of ways these people could have been North American Indians, but somehow that's not much of a criticism. And Gibson's recent PR problems only highlighted, for me, how it took an Australian-reared actor to make an exciting film about natives before Columbus. Clearly Hollywood is incapable of even conceiving of such a movie, much less bringing it brilliantly to life. Hollywood has an agenda and very narrow perspectives. It's agenda has no room for illuminating the humanity of non-Westerners, and there's too much relying on the same old set of sensibilities and intuition. I think if Hollywood is up in arms it ought to be because Gibson is making them look inept.<br /><br />But as to this particular subject matter, there's no doubt in my mind that what fascinates most Anglos about the Aztecs and the Maya is the idea of human sacrifice. Gibson depicts the ritual as having an element of frenzy to it, and he may be right, but what is more convincing to me, at least, is his idea of what a village raid must have been like. His point by point reconstruction is pretty compelling, and I'm quite sure he could make some early American military raids on Indian villages so vivid and unforgettable that grown men would cry. I only hope he does, but as to this film, I would have depicted the human sacrifice with a nod toward a notion most Anglos find completely foreign, namely that these people understood that gain often entails pain, and they were willing to pay the price. Was it really so unreasonable that these people thought God might want them to create pain, and not just endure it, to gain His favor given that life entails so much struggle anyway? That willingness to endure pain clearly survives today, not the desire to create it in others, and that's the only point I would have added to this wonderful film.\n",

The filler being so very bad (time spent on Gary's 'kooky' neighbors and a rather idiotic talk show being the chief offenders) To further compound my misery there wasn't any gore, nor nudity to attempt to liven the preceding up.<br /><br />My Grade: D-\n",

            "Mike Leigh, in my opinion, is the greatest director ever! He needs no animations, CGI, big named stars or million dollar budgets to produce films of pure, simple genius. All or Nothing is no exception and is proving that as he ages his films have gotten better and better.<br /><br />All or Nothing reminds me of life on a council estate as I remember it when I was a kid. There used to be flats on our estate that, although not the same in appearance, where practically the same in their inhabitants: the drunk family, the quiet family (Phil's and Penny's family), the druggie families, the slightly odd kid, the angry violent boyfriend, the single mum with foul-mouth daughter. They were all there. Anyone who knows life on an estate like this would wonder how Mike Leigh can put together such an accurate snapshot into the lives of these families.<br /><br />Mike's films are totally captivating. To some, it might appear like nothing really happens in them, but what I see in them is a reality that is like nothing else on film. Sometimes they're funny, sometimes so almost unwatchably painful but never, ever dull or predictable.<br /><br />Once you're a Mike Leigh fan you're taken to a different level. I just can't take American movies seriously anymore.\n",

A few pseudo-comic scenes, several references to old spanish TV programs and music hits (if you want to feel nostalgic with all that stuff you can watch a spanish TV documentary instead and that'll be surely better), and a surreal plot only understood by the people who made the film.

            "Sitting down for Macbeth the Comedy I was rather expecting a kind of Iris Murdochesque production, full of in-jokes about Shakespeare and Macbeth in particular. How wrong I was. Macbeth: The Comedy takes Shakespeare's well-crafted tale and adds a liberal sprinkling of modern low-level American humour. Apart from lots and lots and lots (many) jokes about gays and lesbians there was an attempt to lace the movie with slapstick comedy, presumably lightening the scene. This didn't work at all, being more the kind of slaphead comedy that doesn't make it much onto tv any more. I was pleasantly surprised to find no toilet humour, but the tone wasn't held much about that with much sniggering concerning the abovementioned lesbian and gay characters in the film: for which one must assume there is a reason.

            "After their very wealthy father of the Whitman family dies three very wealthy brothers set off to India to find their wealthy self-indulgent mother who is undergoing some mental catharsis guilt trip by acting as a nun in a Quasi Christian temple in India. On this journey through India, these three brothers attempt to also attain some spirituality by undergoing ridiculous made up spiritual rituals. The film actually begins with this meaningless episode of Jack Whitman, played by Jason Schwartzman, staying in an upmarket French hotel and having a reunion with his girlfriend played by Natalie Portman. There is a very gratuitous naked scene of Natalie Portman (More for the benefit of the Coppola family she obliges) and that just about ends her contribution to the film except for two seconds at the end. Bill Murray and Angelica Huston also make cameo appearances. The contrast between the three brothers and the absolute poverty of India is brushed over by some stupid interaction in the saving of a child's life and the funeral of one that tragically dies. There is a simplistic attempt at symbolism in the act of unloading luggage.<br /><br />This very cheap self-indulgent film was a further extravagant means of introducing another member of the Coppola family into the film business in the Family Nepotism tradition.<br /><br />This film was written and produced by Roman Coppola and his cousin Jason Schwartzman along with Wes Anderson, who directs the film (he directed the Royal Tenenbaums). Owen Wilson and Adrian Brody play the other two brothers. The film is stupid and tells us nothing about the human condition other than extremely rich trendy men can make short films at the drop of a feather.\n",

Today, people may view these types of film boring, but it is classic Americana. The blue racing jacket, with the white stripes is so 60s. In fact, the jacket is currently displayed in the Hard Rock Cafe in Houston, Texas. It is over the booth that I always sit in when I eat there. A great treat for an Elvis fan. Such notable performers as Bill Bixby, Nancy Sinatra, Gale Gordon, William Schallert, and Carl Ballentine make this film fun for anyone and everyuone who is a fan of classic 60s movies. Add the fact of some Elvis songs, and you can go wrong. I recommend this film to everyone. It is not Elvis' best movie, but certainly in the top ten.\n",

            "Famed martial arts choreographer Cory Yuen (THE TRANSPORTER 1 & 2, X-MEN and ROMEO MUST DIE) directed a Hong Kong film, loaded with bone-crushing stunts and masterful fight scenes with an assembled cast of martial arts masters from the East and West to cross paths.<br /><br />ABOVE THE LAW (aka RIGHTING WRONGS) obtained a vigilante story with dark toned aspects that relies on police corruption and the righteous bending the law to seek their own justice. The stunning martial arts choreography by Cory Yuen kicks into high gear to help make this underrated cop-fu classic a fan favorite.<br /><br />Acrobatic kung-fu genius Yuen Biao (ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA, SHANGHAI EXPRESS (aka MILLIONAIRE'S EXPRESS), THE PRODIGAL SON) plays a court prosecutor whose relentless determination to do away with an untouchable gangster (James Tien- Bruce Lee's THE BIG BOSS, FIST OF FURY) has led him to employ a series of unethical tactics. His investigation becomes complicated by the arrival of a female inspector (played by 5-Time World Karate champion and weapons expert Cynthia Rothrock).<br /><br />Out of all the '80s era fight flicks I have seen Yuen Biao perform in, ABOVE THE LAW was one of his better efforts as an actor and screen fight performer. He exchanges blows with undefeated kickboxing legend Peter \"Sugarfoot\" Cunningham in a (POLICE STORY-style) glass-shattering fight, he also battles Cynthia Rothrock in an engagement of traditional kung-fu, acrobatic fight moves and handcuffs. He has a Jackie Chan stunt moment where he uses his speed and flexibility to dodge speeding cars.<br /><br />Cory Yuen staged these sequences wonderfully and the legendary fight between Cynthia and Biao shows their similarities in timing and skill, which makes their battle an all-time favorite. Karen Shepard, who is another skilled fighter from America and an expert in the mixed art form of Wun Hop Kuen Do kung fu, faces off against Cynthia with the lethal chain whip. Actor Melvin Wong (EASTERN CONDORS and DESCENDANT OF WING CHUN- the film referred in BULLETPROOF MONK-) also gets screen time to execute some martial arts against Yuen Biao. The results of the screen fights earned the film a nomination for Best Action Choreography at the 1987 Hong Kong Film Awards.<br /><br />Of course, fans already know that Cynthia Rothrock is kung-fu's queen of action and a master in various forms of combat like Tae Kwon Do, Wushu, Northern Shaolin kung-fu and Tang Soo Do. Her skills made her a celebrated icon in the sport but unfortunately, she remains highly underrated and overshadowed by the mainstream success of Jackie Chan and Jet Li. Her roles in countless American movies suffer from bad plots and choreography but her presence in Hong Kong films shine like Jackie Chan, and Jet Li does internationally. Her capabilities give her the advantage over many of today's mainstream martial art stars and it is disappointing that her films in the East do not get the proper recognition.<br /><br />For a film made in the '80s, ABOVE THE LAW was a great actioner in martial arts cinema, and all the skilled experts did a great job with their performance.<br /><br />I hope the overshadowing of this classic in the West will end with the new Dragon Dynasty release and capture a wider audience to gain her the type of recognition she deserves as a star.<br /><br />This film was also one of Cynthia and Biao's best performances in screen combat during that era but the praise goes to Cory Yuen because of his skillful direction and casting of martial arts action figures from both worlds to pull the strings. This film will remain a classic in the cinema of martial arts and an unforgettable clashing of two legends in martial arts that deserve the proper recognition.\n",

I don't mind a few stinkers, and I love the campiness of these late 70's/early 80's post-nuke films, but this is probably the worst film I've seen since Blair Witch 2. After a WWIII holocaust, we look in on the lives of a few survivors who are about to cross paths. We have the scum biker gang, the all-American dad and child with a foreign sounding wife and daughter (who have an old man as a mock grandpa),we have the last 2 remaining horses on planet earth, a convent of nuns, and finally a loner stud lookin' for action any way he can get it.<br /><br />All I can say is, all of the horrible clichés are in affect. Absolutely nothing happens for about the first 50-55 minutes except a lot of garbage talk about the way things were and how retarded man is for destroying everything. The rest of the film cannot be considered action, horror, or science fiction in my opinion. You just have to make a whole new genre for films like this and call it the Sh*t genre. You could fit this 90 min. film into a 25 min. TV show package.<br /><br />The editing is horrible also, and you have the feel that some scenes (including the ending) needed more extensions onto them to help tell the story, but I have a feeling this would just prolong the pain of viewing it even more. Please be warned, there's a good reason why less than 30 people have rated this film.\n",

However the characters seem to be stumbling through their lines & the action equals that of a grade school play. None of the characters are believable.

Think *WaterWorld* without the pleasant diversion of being able to look at the ocean. Not only is it pointlessly violent (and I'm a guy who doesn't at all mind the occasional decapitation or disemboweling as someone is telling me a story), but my god is this moving BORING!<br /><br />SPOILERS FOLLOW.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis plays a Bill Sykes-send up with a truly laughable makeup job and an accent that's as carefree as the wind. You never really know why he hates Irish immigrants so much (a mere generation away from being an immigrant himself), and you never understand why everyone in The Five Points slum is so loyal toward and protective of him when he does absolutely nothing to alleviate the poverty and squalor of their senseless, miserable lives. (Oh yeah, since his legitimate front is as a butcher, he occasionally throws a decent steak their way.) Don't get me started on Cameron Diaz, The Whore With The Heart of Gold (because THAT's a story that hasn't been told enough) who, inexplicably is the only character in the movie with clean teeth. Liam Neeson, who croaks before the end of the first reel, is one lucky bastard.<br /><br />After the first 20 minutes, of course, anyone not watching the movie in Braille understands perfectly what the one and only dramatic issue is going to be (REVENGE!!) and you can step out for Chinese while the movie drags its ass toward its inevitable and tedious conclusion. Granted, *Gangs* might have made some use of the obvious Shakespearean themes, but Scorsese doesn't even try to handle them. Thus, though you might entertain a flicker of interest in the Hamletesque question of whether the son will avenge the father, you wind up so bored w/DiCaprio that you don't freakin' care anymore by the time he gets around to doing the deed (which is rather done for him before he even bothers to show up).<br /><br />In fact, though Leonardo keeps staring out at you from that bland little face and trying to convince you that he's struggling with Complex Moral Issues, the fact is: Every single person in this movie is reprehensible and evil, with differences in degree but never in kind. And if there are no good guys, why are you supposed to be cheering at the climactic scene when (for about the 11th time) the streets yet again run gooey w/blood and body parts?<br /><br />And yet, Scorsese tries. Toward the end of the movie, he picks up the nearest blunt instrument and bashes away at the plot until he's grafted an obvious hero (DiCaprio) and an irrelevant hetero love story (DiCaprio and Diaz) onto it. In other words, Martin Scorsese has nothing but contempt for you. You're too stupid to realize that DiCaprio's character is a venal, murderous little crook and you'll be mollified by a pretty romance between him and a sociopathic pickpocket prostitute. Because the history of America began between the sheets.<br /><br />This is the movie you'd get if Oliver Stone and Hannibal Lecter collaborated on an American history epic, and it's about as cynical a piece of trash as I hope never again to see.\n",

The military special effects are laughably fake, with colored smoke substituting for real explosions. I like Weller, Hannah, and Berenger, but even they cannot rise above this horrendous made-for-TV script. In fact, this was easily their worst film -- for all of them. When the actors do stop to give their lines, the result is often unintentionally humorous. There are far too many unnecessary plot elements, making the movie feel like 6 different scripts were thrown into a blender. The scenes stolen from other movies ranging from Mission Impossible to Toy Soldiers are immediately recognizable and come across as gratuitous and weak. It's just a shame. There was so much potential, instead it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen.\n",

            "(Sorry about my English dude i am french)I would hesitate between 7 and 8 mark. but does it matter ? The film is a highly emotional ballad through ordinary lifes. Poelvorde is a truly good actor to me : he has the ability to play ordinary guy but he transform them into heroes! the emotion he can bring to his scenes is terrific. The man has a true quality for generating emotion on screen. The scenes with Jean-Claude Van Dame is beautiful, even though this actor is sometimes laugh at, he appears as an angel in this film. Leny the worldwide karateka champion needs this icon to find a sens to his life. Some people think this is bulls*** : i say one should never laugh at the power of a dream or an idea when it is really the sens of someone life ! I advise you to watch this film if you are not a \"mainstream only\" !\n",

            "Another show exploiting children. They pretend that this is to educate people, but sadly what they portray are little people parents who would rather put their kids to work than support them. Matt is constantly using his LP status as an excuse, for drunk driving, for breaking laws for construction, for whining about his alleged miserable childhood, for not having a real job. Jeremy pretends to be about tolerance but spends his myspace time making racist and homophobic comments and taking homophobic pictures. The family trashes poor Jacob because he dares to have feelings, questioning the masculinity of a child. He is also physically abused by his brothers. The \"farm\" is not that and it's unsafe in many ways. The family cries poverty while adding nearly a million in improvements to the home and taking expensive vacations. They do a gross disservice to LPs everywhere.\n",

That said, you could dismiss the story as just another slice-of-life piece because it does boil down to a simple tale of two old friends getting together for a visit. Still, we care about what happens to everyone involved.<br /><br />For this viewer, the major failing is that I wanted to see more of everyone's stories. I felt the film finished one story at exactly the right moment with the final scene, but I wanted to hear more about the other stories.

You really have an adventure inside of that \"House\", which was a normal two story house. This house thought is gigantic, and full of portals to other worlds. The two heroes are very weak. The plot is lame and boring. There is a zombie cowboy who is supposed to be funny, and he's horrible. He's watching TV in one scene, and sees Ronald Reagan (at that time the President) in an old film, and starts going on and on about how Reagan is a \"sissy\". This is a guy who just entered the eighties after being somewhat dead since the 1800s and he has a liberal left wing bent. Or... maybe it was the writer of the film displaying his political agenda on his sleeve, as happens so much, and always against the right. It's how things are, and people like myself have to take it, take it, and take it some more. This film is horrible. Really bad. There is no plot, bad acting.

The fact that Chris Roberts and company decided to use live actors IN 1993 shows that they care about story and wanted to make it interesting to watch as well as to play. The actors themselves are no slouches when it comes to acting, and have been in several top-of-the-line feature films.<br /><br />Granted, the plot is a familiar one, but when coupled with the WC plot as a whole, it takes on a whole new meaning, and real actors are just what was needed to bring that out.<br /><br />The spaceflight is top-notch... for 1994. Don't expect to see anything even close to today's 3D accelerated colorfests, but do expect to be entertained and challenged.<br /><br />Entertainment is, after all, what we're after here, isn't it?\n",

The oldest gets AIDS from the medicine he takes to help his blood clot. Back before 1985, the medicine was derived from pooled human blood, unscreened for diseases like HIV or HepC. Imagine my surprise to deliver my first child in 2002 and find him diagnosed with hemophilia, which wasn't inherited from my parents. This movie was all the information I had about hemophilia and it was so sad. Luckily, my son's life is nothing like that of the Ben in the movie. Yet, it is a good reminder of the pain the hemophilia community endured because of poor medical treatment. I'd like to find a way to get a copy of this movie.\n",

            "HELLBENT is a tough movie to classify. Yes, it is about a serial killer on one Halloween night in West Hollywood, but it also seems to be a light-hearted takeoff on all the silly teenage massacre horror films. Is it parody or was it meant to be a thriller? No matter, because what we get is an entertaining, well-paced, witty-scripted, full of tension foray through the clubs and alleyways of the very colorful West Hollywood Halloween atmosphere.<br /><br />Don't search for story motivation: there doesn't seem to be one. A devil-garbed body builder beheads boys, leaving the corpses sans heads to the horror of the community just as Halloween festivities are beginning. Our main characters are four friends who are out for a good time, the leader of whom is costumed as a cop and in reality is a wannabe policeman who failed the course due the loss of an eye. His fellow friends are zippy, tight, and fun loving and along the way many of them fall victim to the 'devil's scythe' (and yes, that is shown in grisly detail!). There is a lot of chase action in dark rooms and darker woods and alleys and the fear quotient is pretty high. The problem is the ending, which doesn't answer any plot motivational questions and unfortunately leaves the door open for future follow-up adventures (or is this merely part of the parody of the multitudinous versions of Freddy, I Know What You Did Last Summer, etc teenie flicks?).<br /><br />The cast is attractive and seems to be enjoying themselves as actors. The lighting and costuming and musical scoring are on a par with the best production values of films of this genre. In the end it is fun to see a thriller played solely in the gay community without preachy comparisons or strife with the straight folk. It is entertaining for everyone.\n",

            "I was horribly offended by this film. Andy's friends act like she's selling her soul to work at Runway, as if it's not just an occupational hazard to submit to cruel bosses here and there. The whole premise of her accepting the job in the first place is that she can then move on to enviable roles in other magazines. What the hell is wrong with that?!!! How is spending a year working your ass off some kind of spiritual sin? It doesn't make any sense.<br /><br />And she gets accused of doing to Emily what Priestly does to Tucci's character, but that's so clearly not the case. Why should Andy or anyone else sacrifice their promotion for co-workers that never made any effort to be nice to them in the first place? Ideally promotions are awarded meritocratically and why shouldn't we believe that Andy is just as qualified and deserving of her new responsibilities as Emily? Because she wasn't there as long? That's retarded people! The real world doesn't operate this way. When was the last time you gave up a promotion for some co-worker who was an asshole to you and didn't necessarily do her job as well? The basic message of this movie is that you shouldn't be ambitious, because if you are you will be punished by your friends and family--is this women really need to hear more of this bullshit? You're suppose to presume that had Andy completed her year there she would have set herself permanently on the path to crazed careerism which led to Miranda's second divorce. Oh, everyone at Runway is so unhappy. It's not worth it to be at the top of your field in fashion. I mean, it's absurd.<br /><br />Oh, and sous chef boyfriend at one point declares how they should stop pretending that he and Andy have anything in common anymore. Oh my God. You obviously had precious little in common in the first place if girlfriend + an unusually stressful year of work is enough to eviscerate all that you used to have in common. In the real world, partners go through periods when they become absorbed by intense spells and relationships survive, because in good relationships partners support the long-term goals of their sig others. How do you think doctors complete their residencies with their relationships in tact? The gratuitous fashion montages were fantastic, but Anne Hathaway is a less than formidable talent that works best when she's posing all Brunette Barbie style. I actually walked out after Andy threw her cell phone in the fountain. I figured there wouldn't be anymore eye candy post-Runway and I'd have to sit through some predictable reconciliation scene where she's apologizing to her boyfriend for having had the misguided notion that the people who loved her might enjoy watching her succeed. <br /><br />And it's just a stale, middle-of-the-road mainstream feature in a multitude of other dimensions. Save for Meryl Streep's white hot performance this movie sucks. View this movie only to witness a blatant example of how society wants to sabotage women's economic success.\n",

The cast are very good in their parts, especially Frank Whaley, who's a very funny and charismatic lead and the gorgeous Jennifer Connelly. It also has a slick directing job by Bryan Gordon and a fun cameo by John Candy. I enjoyed the film's first half, which is really funny and clever. It's the films last half, which is a bummer. When the two robbers come in, the film loses mosts of its laughs and becomes pointless and silly. It seems as if John Hughes just ran out of ideas and ripped off his \"Home Alone\" concept, like all of his '90's family movies.

            "Curse of the Puppet Master is set in a small American town where the ever so slightly dim Robert 'Tank' Winsley (Josh Green) works as a lowly gas station attendant for $30 a week, that is until curio collector & owner of a museum of oddities Dr. Magrew (George Peck) & his lovely young daughter Jane (Emily Harrison) stop for gas. Magrew notices that Robert is an extremely skilled carver with an exceptional imagination & offers him $35 a week to work for him, with the $5 a week pay rise too much to turn down Robert accepts. Dr. Magrew show's Robert various living puppets made by puppeteer Andre Toulon that he brought in an auction some years previous & ask's Robert to carve the perfect puppet which Magrew hopes to inject with life & recreate Toulon's success...<br /><br />Curse of the Puppet Master was the fifth sequel to the rather splendid killer puppet flick Puppetmaster (1989) & apparently had the working title Puppet Master 6: The Curse but by this stage it was probably a wise decision to stop numbering them & thus try to fool a few unsuspecting buyers. The first three Puppet Master films were really good & I think they are all great although Puppet Master 4 (1993) & Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter (1994) were pretty bad apart from some impressive stop-motion animation effects & the nicely atmospheric Bogeda Bay Inn setting which are both absent here from Curse of the Puppet Master as the ambitions of the filmmakers & the budget gets increasingly lower with each new entry into the franchise. Directed by David DeCoteau under the name Victoria Sloan one of his many pseudonym's he had actually directed Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge (1991) but there's no repeat of his earlier magic & Curse of the Puppet Master is pretty dire stuff & even at a paltry 75 odd minutes in length the script feels padded & uneventful. There's no continuity to the earlier films at all, there's no mention of the green life giving serum & Curse of the Puppet Master changes the whole central concept to animating the puppets with a human beings soul which is transferred into the puppet thus giving it life instead of the serum from the previous films. To be honest it's a lame story which is supposed to unfold as some sort of mystery but it's pretty predictable & the single worst aspect of Curse of the Puppet Master is that it relegates the killer puppets to no more than bit parts who do virtually nothing the entire film. There's no explanation of why the puppets obey Magrew or why they suddenly turn on him at the end & like the previous two films they are nowhere evil enough. Another thing is while Magrew makes Robert carve a puppet out of wood the puppet Magrew uses at the end is actually made out of metal is some awful looking tank like creation with a couple laser guns for arms. The ending is awful too & is one of those occasions where the film just literally stops dead & your left thinking 'is that it?' or 'what happened?' or 'did my DVD player just skip a chapter?'.<br /><br />The puppet special effects are the worst of the series so far too, there's a few seconds of stop-motion by the vast majority of the effects work is simple poorly operated rod puppets which look still & have very limited movement. The opening credits have a montage of special effects shots from the previous five films & they beat anything else seen in this. For some reason the puppet Torch is ditched even though he appeared in Puppet Master 5 while Leech Woman makes a reappearance for the first time in the series after having been burnt in Puppet Master II (1991). The film is gorier than either parts 4 o5 although two bloody murders don't make this particularly good, there's some slashing & bloody cuts & Tunneller sticks his drill into some guy's groin & his wedding tackle. The whole film & production just looks cheaper than the previous entries, the moody setting & lighting have all but gone & there's a bland visually flat & dull look to it.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $250,000 the budgets were getting lower & lower & it show's frankly. Apparently shot at Canoga Park in Los Angeles. The acting is forgettable from no-one I have ever heard of before.<br /><br />Curse of the Puppet Master is worse than the five previous Puppet Master films & to be honest they should have stopped making them after Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge while the series was on a high. The only Puppet Master film I have left to watch in the series now is Retro Puppet Master (1999) which I can't say I am particularly looking forward too.\n",

The people who understood STARTSHIP TROOPERS, and those who didn't. These are people who looked at the superficial exterior and then stopped there, failing to see the true brilliance of the satire and the other fascinating qualities it had to offer. These are the kind of people who look at the sand on the beach, and see only dry sand. They then assume that all the sand is dry, even though it is wet just below the surface.<br /><br />Best men is like Mamet in that the dialogue is not the way real people talk, but is stylized, much like Shakespeare stylized his. The way shakespeare wrote was far from the way people talked back then. BEST MEN actually has close ties to shakespeare, as his work plays a major part in the plot. The film is in a way a tribute to shakespeare and his work. The script is in my opinion one of the best and most layered scripts I have ever seen or heared. Unfortunately I don't know if most people will realize how good it really is. The acting is acceptable for the most part. The only really great performances are turned in by Dean Kane, and Brad Dourif (who is one of my very favorite character actors.<br /><br />If you are going to see this movie, I would recommend seeing it with a completely open mind, have no pre-notions of what it will be, because you won't get what you are expecting. I didn't, I expected a Drew Barrymore movie, but she actually has a rather small role, but I good one.\n",

Of course he's dead in an upstairs bedroom where his S&M equipment is located, along with his collection of exotic weapons, one of which has been used to hack him to death. Who could have done such a horrible deed? We know right away that the dead rich guy was a morally corrupt creep and probably got what he deserved, but the detective character, who is really an assistant district attorney (Caruso), has to investigate, right? Right away I didn't care much who did it. That's a bad sign in a mystery. <br /><br />Now there's this woman, who's not only a prostitute but a psychiatrist, and a major psychopath: \"Jade\" (Fiorintino). She's married to the ADAs best friend, a rich defense attorney (Palminteri) and the ADA used to be in love with her. Neither knows that at night she goes out to a high-class whore house in Pacifica and sells her angular body to fulfill the twisted fantasies of rich, powerful, morally corrupt old men. <br /><br />The plot doesn't so much thicken as curdle. The governor of the State of California (Crenna) is involved, and he's the most morally corrupt of all. Little more than a meaty Mafia boss or tinpot dictator, he orders hits and hurls threats. He should have a cigar to chew. And of course he too is a patron of the notorious \"Jade.\" He's obviously responsible for several murders but, as others have pointed out, is never brought to justice.<br /><br />This plot doesn't make any sense. \"Jade,\" the psychopathic psychiatrist, is a cypher, we never get a sense of motive or emotion or even of emotional injury. She's as cold as dry ice. Caruso seems to want to save her, but really, didn't she bring it all on herself? And she is one of the most unlikable, and most un-sexy femme fatale ever to flounce on the silver screen. She obviously hates having sex with her husband, but he wants her even more when he finds out she's rotten. <br /><br />This stylish thriller is just too stylish for its own good. It's all surface. The characters are shallow and unlikable, the plot makes no sense, the chase scenes are well done but contribute nothing to the story. If you like a glitzy surface you might like \"Jade\" but otherwise, forget it.\n",

            "The main virtue of \"Death on the Nile\" is Agatha Christie's unbeatable whodunit plot, which is arguably even more beautifully constructed than that of \"Murder on the Orient Express.\" The latter had been adapted for the screen in 1974 by one of America's great filmmakers, Sidney Lumet.<br /><br />Like its predecessor, \"Death on the Nile\" was filmed with a fine all-star cast, in which Peter Ustinov, Bette Davis, Mia Farrow and Jack Warden stand out. Ustinov's Hercule Poirot is perhaps a bit less eccentric than Albert Finney's or David Suchet's, but I actually like all three interpretations.<br /><br />The film is as lavishly produced as \"Orient Express.\" It has nice costumes and beautiful natural locations. John Guillermin isn't as strong a director as Lumet is. Consequently, the images in \"Death on the Nile\" are pretty, but less artistically interesting than those in the preceding film. Moreover, Guillermin's visual storytelling is a bit repetitive (he shows all the possible versions of the murder in detail, which tends to become a bit tedious after a while), and the first half could have been shortened a bit. Still, the direction is way above average, and Guillermin handles the action scenes and the solution in a convincing way. <br /><br />To me, \"Murder on the Orient Express\" is the most artistically satisfying Poirot film, but \"Death on the Nile\" is the most entertaining of the Poirot adaptations with Ustinov as the Belgian detective. \"Evil Under the Sun\" is also enjoyable, since its strong second half more than compensates for the overlong exposition.<br /><br />I'd give \"Death on the Nile\" a rating of *** out of ****.\n",

            "I just recently saw this movie expecting it to be good and was definitely disappointed to find out that the killer was nothing more than a crocodile. The really sad part is that the sub-plot (the warlord stuff) was better than the main plot. That's pretty sad in my opinion. It was pretty decent with the gore, but it was still kinda disappointing to me. It was also too predictable. I like movies where I'm wrong when I guess what comes next. This one, my predictions were always right. Everything from who gets killed next to the warlord's true id and everything. I know that I gave this movie a 4 and that I am complaining a lot about it, but the gore was pretty good and the sub-plot was pretty decent, so that's why it gets at least a 4.\n",

Yes, Loic is enigmatic and incredibly attractive, and the film could have developed well based on that, but instead it wanders hopelessly after its first 20 minutes and becomes essentially 90% talk and 10% plot. That gets old fast. Even the few unusual \"incidents\" toward the end -- which I'd guess are there to provide a shock or epiphany -- seem pointlessly surreal.<br /><br />The director indulges a number of disconnected fetishes for no apparent purpose. What are we supposed to make of the recurring shots of the Alps, or the distressed and always-bandaged eyebrow piercing? If these are supposed to be symbolic of something about Loic, their meanings are far too obscure. If the writers intended to make us guess at these things, that's a tired, pretentious technique that I think ends up being merely annoying, not clever.\n",

But in the end, I just had to, because I'm an absolute science fiction lover- so I took the risk.<br /><br />When the movie starts you immediately see that this is no B-movie. The special effects are of a high standard, the acting is like you may expect from Hollywood actors and the music is damn good. This movie could very well have played in theaters, in my humble opinion.<br /><br />So, why do I give it a 7 and not an 8? I give an 8 only to movies that still make me think about them the next day; and when I feel that I have to recommend them to others in the confidence that they will like it too. The only reason, therefore, that this movie isn't an 8 is because I LIKED the movie - but I'll probably have forgotten about it tomorrow. The idea behind the movie: someone has a small device that can take them back in time a few minutes-- could have served for some master plot that gets more and more complex, with twists and Ooohs and Aaahs-- making you laugh out loud, thinking \"Why didn't I think about that?\" and \"Can it get ANY more complex/genius?\"... But instead, that doesn't happen. The movie doesn't really explore a new level of story line, only possible with time travel. Afterwards you have the satisfaction that you have when you just saw another good bank robbery movie, or a hijack movie. Fun, but no more than that. Still, I wish the reviews had been better; they might have made a TV series of this and I would have definitely enjoyed that.\n",

But that such a comparatively modern film, featuring name stars such as Nigel Hawthorne and Julie Christie could be so mind-numbingly bad beggars description.<br /><br />The opening screen reads \"When Things Stopped\". It's puzzlingly inaccurate as we know officials have working helicopters. Could the film makers be unawares of the complex infrastructure needed to keep those delicate machines flying? Hardly something you'd expect after societal collapse. The opener is accurate in one sense, though as much of the film left me feeling the plot - what there was of it - had stopped.<br /><br />Christie? She practically send a surface mail letter in to stand for her performance. Much of the film has her so listless that one wonders if the character (or actress) has been shot with an elephant tranq dart.<br /><br />The bit with the wall that's a gateway to another reality? Excuse me? What possible reason would Christie's character have for wanting to return to her dismal reality after her first time through? The whole concept made absolutely no sense whatsoever. And the kids dancing around the giant egg? Just what drugs did someone slip in the writers' drinking water? <br /><br />A memorable passage from Ayn Rand's book THE FOUNTAINHEAD has a character reading something which is essentially gibberish and thinking it \"...must be profound because he didn't understand it.\" Wanting to be sure about that here, I showed it to a friend who, at the time, was working on her psych doctorate (with a Lit minor). The film over I asked her if there was something, some deep, subtle meaning I was missing. She replied by pointing out that some non-conforming stories are trying to tie into (she spewed forth psych-babble-double-talk) and make reference to literary (more jargon). Pausing, she looked at the now turned off TV screen, then back to me and went on ...<br /><br />\"And then there's films such as this which are just garbage, plain and simple.\"\n",

It's beautifully put together, with lots of humour, the attractive Colin Firth and many superb performances. Celia Imrie creates a colourful character in Mrs Quickly, Imelda Staunton is fantastic as the cook (Mrs Blatherwick) and Angela Lansbury is expertly cast as Aunt Adelaide (despite the feathered dress making her look like a turkey!) As guessed at on another thread, Nanny McPhee does teach the children - that manners matter, you should be responsible for your actions, and that actions have consequences. It isn't dumbed down, there's certainly no 'dopey dialogue' - and there's also no annoying Americanisms as beset Charlie & the Chocolate Factory.<br /><br />At first glance, you could imagine Emma Thompson giving a very over the top performance, given the warts, over-sized nose and tooth. Instead she gives a careful and considered performance - everything in the right measure.<br /><br />Enjoy Nanny McPhee for what it is - a large dose of magical escapism with plenty of laughs for good measure. A few rude words and food fights to keep the kids (and parents) happy, oh and a dancing donkey, but overall a film that is lots of fun. Can't wait for the DVD.\n",

After months in interplanetary flight, the manned spacecraft Destiny prepares for the final two hours before separation of the landing module, and its flight to the surface of the Red Planet. The news agency GNN (Global News Network) covers these last two hours before the historic touchdown, using state-of-the-art technology, and even a correspondent aboard Destiny itself. However, powers are at work that aims at stopping the historic landing, and bring utter chaos back home. All we can do, is watch the show...<br /><br />Journey to Mars is a great TV-movie, even though it has quite a few scientific errors (as how they conquered the speed of light - which is necessary to send instant transmition from Earth to Mars - which takes 4 hours each way with today's radio-technology - maybe they use some kind of Tachyon-beams?), but if you are willing to forgive these errors, you may find this quite a good movie - certainly something out of the ordinary.<br /><br />The film is made as GNN's live coverage of the historic landing, and like the hit-series \"24\", events occur in real-time. They succeeded admirably in making it look like we really were watching a special, braking-news report of CNN (or in the case of the movie, GNN), and the atmosphere really feels as such, which makes the movie even more interesting.<br /><br />The plot evolves a lot over the course of the movie, and takes quite some unexpected turns, in the end you'll be sitting glued to the screen as Destiny zooms over the Martian surface - it really feels as if it's actually happening for real!<br /><br />The acting is generally quite good, near perfect at times, but the atmosphere is what really makes this film something really special, as it builds up over time.<br /><br />The last few minutes are arguably the best and most atmospheric moments you'll ever experience in a TV movie like this, so I wont ruin them for you, but just suffice to say they are well above excellent.<br /><br />The special effects really aren't so important in this kind of movie, but they are still quite well done. Although you may loose hope after seeing the opening zoom-over of the Martian surface (which is taken from a NASA animation by the looks of it), the effects gets a whole LOT better over time.<br /><br />So, as I overall liked this movie because of good plot and atmosphere, and also because of mostly good acting, I give it a final score of 8/10.\n",

The lead actress is shown as a very negative but memorable character, and every situation is seen from her angle, the one of a girl trying to redeem herself in such a negative way. Overall the film is excellent for its fullness and for its realistic roles (Angie's father as well).\n",

            "The Hoaxters only rates a four out of ten. The production value is very high, and it has big-name stars doing the narration, but the subject is so repugnant that it is almost nauseating to watch.<br /><br />I'm glad it wasn't listed as a Documentary, because it is certainly anything but. Its purpose is indoctrination, pure and simple. It is sort of the American version of a Leni Riefenstahl film, except that her films are a lot more upbeat and enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />It starts out equating Hitler, Mussolini and Hirohito. Then, the first banner headline word zooms across the screen: \"COMMUNISM\" Almost immediately, Stalin is equated with the first three. \"All dictators are the same,\" is chanted throughout the film at intervals in between segments of the narration.<br /><br />The film is a classic example of what George Orwell termed \"double-think.\" It rails against \"The Big Lie\" while at the same moment spouting some of the most incredible whoppers I have ever heard! Just a minor example is J. Edgar Hoover, the King of Blackmail, stating that he would never want to see anyone publicly embarrassed as a result of his investigations.<br /><br />At one point, it is railing against dictators and the one-party system, and in the same breath has the nerve to show film footage of Senator Joseph McCarthy! <br /><br />The thing I personally found most offensive was its presentation that all the anti-war protests at the White House were engineered and funded by the International Communist Party, and that as soon as Stalin and Hitler had a falling out, the demonstrations instantly evaporated.<br /><br />The film kept my interest. In fact, it is fascinating. But rather in the same morbid way as I imagine watching a train wreck taking place would be.<br /><br />At the very least, \"The Hoaxters\" is worth watching as a lesson in history, and also as a textbook example of propaganda techniques which are still widely used and very effective today.\n",

            "A little known fact about me is that I'm a big fan of fluffy romantic comedies. Why wouldn't you want to spend 90 minutes or so watching a film; laughing and ultimately feeling good at the end of it? I don't consider fluffy romance films to be at the absolute top of cinema, but they're good fun, and therefore get a thumbs up from me. The Wedding Singer, however, gets not one thumb up; but both thumbs, firmly, up. So, why does The Wedding Singer succeed more than most films in it's sub genre? Is it the jokes? The beautiful female lead? The gratuitous helping of 80's pop songs? No, it's that this movie has a lot of heart; that's what makes it a winner.<br /><br />Adam Sandler stars as the quintessential 'loser'. He's a wedding singer, and not a very good one either. He specialises in doing terrible covers of 80's songs. It's not the sort of act that I would want at my wedding. His life gets worse one day, his wedding day, to be exact, when someone doesn't turn up. The bride, that is. Now in a deep spiral of depression, our hero doesn't see any way forward. His next gig is a washout and there's love all around him; even his newfound friend, the cute little waitress that works at the same place as him is getting married. And to a man who doesn't deserve her, I might add. I don't think I really need to tell you what comes next, but even though it's a predictable ride; trust me, it's a ride you want to be on. <br /><br />Adam Sandler tends to be a very annoying actor; and for that reason he is almost universally disliked, but it is undeniable that he is good in this movie. Nobody else could have given the character what Sandler gave him; his performance is both entertaining and believable, and therefore is just right for the movie. Drew Barrymore was also perfectly cast. She is the perfect girl in this movie; all smiles and sunshine, and it's impossible not to fall in love with her. The movie also features great little turn from Steve Buscemi, who provides the film with one of it's funniest moments towards the start.<br /><br />As mentioned; The Wedding Singer has a lot of heart. From the way that the characters interact with each other, particularly Sandler and Barrymore, it is obvious that they are in love. The movie also has some points to make on the subject of love; The Wedding Singer portrays that being in love is overall better than being a 'Fonz' type, womanising character. The message at the movie's centre is also a worthwhile one; the movie professes that it isn't important who you fall in love with; it doesn't matter whether or not he's merely a wedding singer, all that matters is the love between two people. The movie says that love is all you need; and that is a worthwhile message in any movie. The movie's message is lost somewhat under the barrage of jokes; but it's most certainly there and I for one think that it's a shame that a movie that is entertaining and funny can't be considered in the same league as other, more serious movies with a similar message.<br /><br />Overall, The Wedding Singer is at the very top of the romantic comedy genre. It will make you laugh, and you will ultimately feel for the characters. The fact that this movie has something to say is only another reason to recommend it; especially as it says it with a great big smile on it's face. The Wedding Singer is not a film that you will want to miss; it's feel-good at it's best.\n",

She showed little talent for playing mealy-mouthed, self-sacrificing women. I think most of her fans will be appalled by this film, especially by the ending, which will leave most modern audiences speechless.

            "After spending a long time searching for this movie, I finally found a store that had it on VHS for less than $1, and I immediately popped it in my VCR when I got home.<br /><br />After reading about the plot I was hooked right away: In the future, kick-boxing has been overtaken by cryogenically enhanced fighters, only one man is still 100% human, but when he refuses to fight in the ultimate lethal tournament, the arrangers kidnap his girlfriend/manager and force him to compete! <br /><br />The movie did not disappoint me at all, but that might be because I saw so many familiar faces in it, being an avid Albert Pyun-fan, he used the same set of actors he always does: Jahi J. J. Zuri is making his film-debut as one of the fighters, and Thom Mathews is also playing a sympathetic fighter in the tournament, being forced to fight in the competition by the evil mastermind Tung. Tung is played by Pyun's most frequent collaborator, the flamboyant Norbert Weisser, who is aided by always entertaining Tim Thomerson, who here plays the synthetic red-headed leader of corporate scumbags. Earl White and Chad Stahelski are also two guys Pyun uses often, and they're in the movie as Budokam fighters, of which there are plenty.<br /><br />Although the star of the movie is not one of his regulars, Keith H. Cooke, known from \"China O'Brien\", here plays the last 100% human kick boxer in the world, Chance O'Brien (co-incidence? I think not), and he actually does quite a good job. The martial arts-superstar Gary Daniels (from \"Fist of the North Star\") is a great bad guy, with his icy-blue eyes and nonchalant attitude, and the woman both men love is also a Pyun-regular, Tina Coté, who hasn't done many movies yet, but always gives her best performances in Pyun's movies (like \"Nemesis 2\", \"Mean Guns\", and \"Omega Doom\"). This was actually the first movie I've seen where she did not play an obnoxious b*tch, so that was a new experience.<br /><br />The fight-sequences in the movie are interesting, but after a while it does tend to be a bit tedious to watch, and at times fast-forwarding is probably a good idea to keep interest. If you like both cyborgs and kick-boxing this is definitely a movie you should watch, but if either turns you off, you should probably stay away, as that is pretty much all there is going on in this movie.<br /><br />Highlight: Keith Cooke running around naked in the Phillipines. The abundance of man-ass is hilarious, but if you're homophobic, this might at first turn you off, but later we get to see Tina Coté's nipples, so there's something for both men and women in this movie, cyborgs or not.\n",

            "The \"Clear and Present Danger\" of the title is the danger posed by the influx of drugs coming into the USA. This third installment of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series is an exciting adventure of intrigue.<br /><br />We pick up Ryan a couple of years after \"Patriot Games\" where he is living happily after with his wife Cathy (Anne Archer) a successful doctor, and his two kids, Sally (Thora Birch) and a new son Jack Jr. (Alexander Lester). Admiral Greer (James Earl Jones), Ryan's mentor is suddenly taken ill and appoints Ryan as his replacement as Deputy Director of National Security.<br /><br />Meanwhile, friends of President Bennett (Donald Moffat) have been murdered and connected to the drug lords of Columbia. The President's National Security Adviser, James Cutter (Harris Yulin) and his assistant Ritter (Henry Czerny) arrange to have a group of US Army snipers under the direction of agent John Clark (Willem Dafoe)infiltrate Columbian territory and disrupt the drug trade by destroying drug shipments.<br /><br />Drug lord Ernesto Escobedo (Miquel Sandoval) becomes alarmed and assigns his security chief Felix Cortez (Joaquim de Almeida) to find out who is responsible. Cortez gains the confidence of the secretary of the FBI Director, Moira Wolfson (Ann Magnuson) and learns that Director Jacobs (Tom Tammi) will been sent to Columbia on a secret mission by the President. Ryan already in Columbia, will join the party.<br /><br />Cortez, who has ambitions of his own, sees this as his chance to take over and attacks the convoy carrying the FBI Director and Ryan. Director Jacobs and Ryan's friend, FBI agent Dan Murray (Tim Grimm) are killed.<br /><br />Back in Washington, Ryan continues his investigation and begins to suspect Ritter and Cutter. Cortez having no further use for Moira, murders her the same day that her boss is killed, which alerts Ryan to his involvement.<br /><br />Ryan learns that Cortez plans to overthrow Escobedo and take over. Cutter and Ritter panic and close down Clark's operation trapping his men in the Columbian jungle. Ryan, realizing that he has been set up by the politicians, goes to Columbia once more and enlists Clark's help to rescue the survivors. As Ryan negotiates for their release things suddenly go wrong and...........................<br /><br />Director Philip Noyce gives us plenty of explosive action among the deceit and double crossing. Harrison Ford again turns in an excellent performance as Ryan, who at times seems to be a fish out of water in his new job. Czerny and Yulin make slimy villains and Moffat a believable President. Willem Dafoe as the abandoned Clark has some good moments as well. Anne Archer has little to do (pity) in this one but to be there for Jack.<br /><br />Watch for Benjamin Bratt as the chief of the commandos, Dean Jones as Ryan's boss and Hope Lange as Senator Mayo who grills Ryan on his budget proposal.<br /><br />Followed by \"The Sum of All Fears\" (2002) in which a much younger Ben Affleck takes over as Jack Ryan....go figure.\n",

I was very impresses with Hotep and Hut. They really gave the story a darker side. The tenth plague was drawn so well, I fell in love with the movie immediately. My favorite part was when Moses saw the burning bush, and when he parted the Red Sea. It was all drawn so well, that you could automatically lose yourself in the movie, and not want it to end. I however did not like when Moses accidentally killed the guard on the structure. It was disappointing to know that Ramases thought he could make it all go away.

An unusual hybrid of THE MALTESE FALCON and TOTAL RECALL, SOMEWHERE IN THE NIGHT was ahead of its time and has aged better than most amnesiac fare. One could argue that TOTAL RECALL owes quite a debt to this movie regarding its twist bad guy identity revelation. There's some excellent dialogue and once you overlook some whopper implausibilities, the plot works well, as does the oddball cast of supporting characters, including the opportunist police lieutenant and the rogues gallery of ne'er do wells hoping to cash in on the amnesiac's memories. The movie doesn't hold up to close scrutiny (how did the money hanging under a pier not rot from three years' worth of salt water for one) but it is highly entertaining and noir fans should definitely take a look.

The kid attacks the bad guy and his Mightor mask covers his eyes. Whilst he can't see, the real Mightor defeats the bad guy. The kid lifts his mask and thinks he did it himself.

Everything about this movie screams class--from the sight gags to the outrageous costumes (which if you really look at the costumes and sets they probably cost a fortune in Depression money) Laurel and Hardy are great for the whole movie with some of the goofiest antics I've seen in any of their films (selling mouse traps: they drill holes in the floor so the mice can get in and then cap them with golf balls so they can't get back out) The gorilla in Switzerland is hilarious (and really random) but makes me laugh every time. The organ filled with soap is fun as well as the great fight scene with the chef, and their antics in the kitchen.

            "MISS JULIE is a film based on a play written by August Strindberg and directed by Mike Figgis . Strindberg was of course a Swedish dramatist who was famous for his unconscious predictions . One of his plays featured a Japanese character called Hiroshima who wanted to be burned alive and watching MISS JULIE any self respecting audience member will notice that the plot predates DH Lawrance's LADY CHATTERLY'S LOVER . This may make the story groundbreaking but it doesn't make it entertaining , erotic or interesting . In fact Figgis seems to have made a pig's ear of the whole thing by casting Saffron Burrows and Peter Mullan as the two protagonists of the story . Burrows is tall , slim and elegant while Mullan is a wee middle aged Scottish guy and the two of them make one of the most unlikely screen couples ever committed to celluloid and their lust filled relationship is very difficult to believe in . Figgis also fails to make the movie cinematic with most of the (in )action taking place inside a kitchen save for a few scenes in a studio exterior . It should also be pointed out that because it's a stage play the dialogue is very important but due to some very poor sound mixing it's almost impossible to hear what the actors are saying .

            "I am not the biggest James Bond fan, but I have quite enjoyed the franchise. Until now. There are so many things in this film that do not make sense that I don't know where to begin.<br /><br />First of all I am convinced that Daniel Craig had a hangover one day (one of many judging by his face) and was offered a role in the movie called Casino Royale about which he most certainly thought that it is a sequel to his well made Layer Cake, for which he would be perfect. A successful cocaine dealer working his way to be England's Mafia elite will suit him much better than the British suave top spy. The phrase: \"The men want to be him and the women want to be with him\" does not match the criteria. I could not help but laugh seeing him emerging from the water with his egg shaped head, the sticking out trans illuminating ears and the straw organized hair. I definitely did not want to be him. Only thing to redirect the concentration of a movie goer to something else was to put him in the gym for six months prior to the shooting of the movie.<br /><br />Second of all I went to see this movie with a bit of objectivity, listening to critics saying that it is a very well made action movie. I probably went to see the wrong film. The only exiting action sequence is the free-running chase through the streets in Uganda. It involved the free running champion Sebastien Foucan where Craig's stunt was trying his best not to ruin the scene. Otherwise there are no new ideas no new camera angles and most of the scenes have been in the other movies before. The petrol tank truck chase on the airport runway is like a bad copy from the Raiders of the Lost ark. Harrison did a much better job and it was original.<br /><br />The sequence where Bond is mistaken for a parking attendant is the only ray of bright witty humor Bond is supposed to have and is missing and again it was used in the movies so many times before. (The latest I remember by Vin Diesel in XXX) The whole scene was badly executed and with no follow up logic. Why would security guys run towards the car to find out what has happened when there are security cameras in the security room which was left open for Bond to use the equipment??? Don't even let me start on the car chase. Sorry, what car chase? Bond goes around a couple of curves and unintentionally (when was the last time Bond unintentionally?) wrecks the car. Yes he is a great actor, just watch his facial expression before the stunt man breaks the world record in \"car flipping\". Unforgettable.<br /><br />Editing of the poker games in the casino is just amateurish. Cutting the fight scene in half to add a dialog from different surroundings just for the viewer to find out that \"Mr. Bond has changed his shirt\" is called home made editing.<br /><br />Making the movie about the beginnings of James Bond earning his \"00\" status? You start with a black and white scene which really gives you an impression about the times before it all started. Good. You pick a 38 year old actor who looks \"used\". Bad. You give him no gadgets. Good. Except latest satellite navigation telephones and a high tech heart defibrillator which is a standard accessory of his latest model Aston Martin (by the way Mrs. Broccoli did you really think that invisible car previously was unrealistic?). Bad. Now you have a top spy so you give him an anti terrorist mission. Good. His task is to recover a mere 150 million. Bad. Can someone add this up for me? In conclusion this film is an average movie without any pace or plot, with no new action no leading actor or actress in that matter, no plot and no meaning at all.\n",

            "Beware! This poor excuse for a movie is neither a remake of George A. Romero's Day of the Dead, nor is it a sequel to the decent remake of Dawn of the Dead. Oh sure, people who like it and the director himself will tell you it's a remake of the classic, but not a single speck of the original remains. Instead, it is another \"for dumb teens only\" horror picture that lacks any real scares, is laden with awful clichés and ultimately fails because it bares the name and thus, seemingly tries to live up to the standards set by the infinitely better \"original\". The producers saw the opportunity to put a big name on a small (figuratively speaking) movie in efforts to grab some cash and did so without any regard for how it would effect the finished product.<br /><br />This film is awful, make no mistake - but had it not set people up to see a remake of a classic it may have passed at least as a mildly entertaining failure as opposed to a total waste of time that is offensive to it's own genre. This is where you find the divide amongst IMDb forum users, horror/zombie fans who hate it and regular people who didn't seem to mind it. That being said, one quote from the message boards rings true for everyone, \"Enjoy it all you want but this is NOT a good movie.\"\n",

            "This is a magnificent film directed by Lewis Milestone, who made so many superb movies. It is a bit dated and 'stagey' in its opening minutes, partly because it is taken from the play, not the novel, by John Steinbeck, and also because so many of the outstanding cast were only making their second or third film, and needed warming up and getting used to the camera. Once into its stride, however, this classic tale progresses with relentless fatality to explore all the sadness of loners and drifters with such heart-breaking intensity that it really gets you at gut level. In a sense, the loneliness, impossible dreams, and searing heartaches of the many drifting, unfulfilled, and lost characters are the real heart of this story, which thus embodies the pain of the Depression in the personal lives of several people who suffer, suffer, and, well, suffer. The main storyline is the touching relationship of the retarded giant Lennie, played by Lon Chaney, Junior, and his friend who travels and works with him, and looks after him like a zealously protective brother, played by the young Burgess Meredith. Although Chaney over-acts, he over-acts consistently, which is the secret of over-acting successfully. The result is that Chaney's character achieves full pathos, despite not being a particularly subtle performance. Chaney is no restrained and measured Dustin Hoffmann, and when he is playing someone retarded, he flaunts it, and blurts it. But we accept that. He is the gentle giant who crushes all the little rabbits and puppies he loves because he can never understand his own strength, and his pathetic efforts to remember the simplest things are totally convincing. Burgess Meredith, near the beginning of his film career, gives one the finest of his many inspired performances, showing a shining power of love and devotion rarely seen on the screen with a male character, or someone who is neither father nor mother. Betty Field, also starting out on the screen, is superb as the young wife on the ranch tormented by boredom almost to the point of insanity. The scene where she and the retarded Lennie sit and 'converse', never really connecting but each pursuing a desperate individual monologue, is one of the most effective scenes of its kind ever filmed. This film contains so many moving performances that it is like a showcase of pathos. Roman Bohnen, astonishingly aged only 45 at the time (and he died aged only 54! - a great loss!), plays a pathetic old man desperately attempting to grasp a last thread of a possible dream, having had the only love of his life, an old dog, torn from him and shot, so that he is deprived of anything and everything, stripped bare, a naked, lost soul, as so many in this story are lost souls. Leigh Whipper is outstandingly subtle in his portrayal of an ostracised black worker who mixes bitterness, sympathy, love, hate, and venom all in one well-rounded package, an incredible achievement in a short time on screen. Bob Steele is totally convincing as the repellent young husband of Betty Field, whose manic jealousy and general paranoia rise steadily to a crescendo of intensity. This is a desperate film about desperate people. The relationship of the hopelessly retarded Chaney with his friend Meredith is completely convincing, and heart-breaking to the ultimate degree. One hopes that some of these characters can achieve some semblance of a dream, that even one of them can escape the endless wheel of torment and emotional deprivation and lack of fulfillment. I have known people who resembled these more than is comfortable. This multiply tragic tale is not just devastatingly close to the bone, it is the bone.\n",

            "Enjoyable film, though more like a play, examining relationships between two married couples. Scores highly with me for an excellent script. The main players give full-blooded self-indulgent and self centred performances. One message from the movie is, if you want to make a marriage,it takes hard work; more importantly the film suggests some of us are not suited for that institution. I thought the ending was a bit too cosy, but on the whole the writing and directing gives this film an 8 out of 10 from me.\n",

            "An hour and a half of practically dead air kill an interesting concept in this Korean action-drama. By the last 30 minutes I was looking for a hard surface to bash my head against while yelling at the actors to DO SOMETHING! <br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br /><br />Other than that, I laughed quite a bit throughout the film. It wasn't made to be a comedy, but it turned out that way. Even the WTF plot twist earned a chuckle from me. So this Japanese controlled Korea wasn't an alternate universe, but the work of an evil Japanese family/ corporation and some seemingly inept archaeologists? I don't know why the Koreans hated being under Japanese rule so much, it didn't seem any worse than having to worry about Kim Jong Il and communism. <br /><br />Whatever Korea.<br /><br />I really liked the two main characters police partners/ life partners dynamic (until the fem partner turned into an EVIL Japanese PIG, of course). Oh, and I can't forget the girl/boy/chimp (what was it?!). It was fun to watch everyone mow down everything with guns, but pause during the mayhem so the heroes could stop and grieve, or take a nap, or... just... stand... there... <br /><br />And the end. What? Why did...?<br /><br />Oh, never mind, this movie is just a jumbled mess of WTF moments, sheer hilarity and ZZZ's. Big fans of foreign films or B- Scifi's might enjoy it... but, I doubt it.

            "It's a strongest film I know. Every time I watch it, it bewilders me so I can't turn my eyes away from the screen, even though I remember all what happens by heart. It fills me with a strange mixed feeling of interest-sympathy-admiration-disgust-and-horror. One of the reviewers here called this film depressing, and I inclined to agree. Any picture of Berlin in 1931 must be depressing and frightening. But, on the other hand, there is an atmosphere of desperate reckless joy in the movie. When the entire world goes mad and speeds to a catastrophe, life is a cabaret! Do what you can, come hear the music play, don't permit some prophet of doom wipe every smile away, and end as the happiest corpse! It's one idea. There is also another, more humanistic: live and let live. Brian fails to understand Sally, so they fall apart. Fritz for the sake of his love faces the danger of admitting that he is Jew in Germany. There is no hope for him and Natalia in this country in this time. But he couldn't do otherwise. There are plenty of other ideas too: about money, politics, corruption, perverseness, decadence, stupidity of middle classes, talent, success, etc. The story is very simple and incredibly complicated in the same time. No use retelling it. It must be seen. It's life as it was in 1931 and in many ways as it is nowadays. I suppose that Cabaret would be a great film even without any musical numbers, but with them it is a masterpiece. They say that history repeats itself, for the first time as a tragedy, for the second time as a farce. Well, I would say that in Cabaret every event repeats itself for the first time as a human drama in life and for the second time as a farce on the stage, but it would not be exactly true. Life and farce are shown synchronically or farce even go in advance. But every staged number in divinely decadency Kit Kat Klub ruthlessly shows the naked truth of life. (Only Mein Herr and Maybe This Time have more to do with the character of Sally Bowles.) And of course, Tomorrow Belongs To Me must be mentioned separately. The way of German people towards fascism is presented in one startling scene. And in finale too. That distorted reflection of the audience full of Nazi, accompanied by a tense silence after Master's of Ceremonies Aufwiedershen' is horrible. The movie due half of its unforgettable effect to the masterful camera shots. Actors' works are absolutely fantastical. Surely, Master Of Ceremonies is Joel Grey star role. He is amazing as that demonic shameless figure that seems to know everything, understand everything and deride everything. Liza Minnelli shines in every scene, acting, speaking, singing and dancing. I know few performances equally true, strong, brilliant and stylish as hers as Sally Bowles. Michael York is excellent as well, though he is often underestimated. It's only his character who is reserved, intelligent and avoids show-off. And he is perfectly British. I really admire York's acting in the movie. There are also beautiful Marisa Berenson as noble Natalia, Fritz Wepper very believable as tormented Fritz, repulsively attractive Helmut Griem as the rich scoundrel Maximilian and picturesque supporting cast. John's Kander's music is wonderful and haunting. <br /><br />Shortly, Cabaret is a work of a genius, or it would be better to say of geniuses: Bob Fosse and the crew and the cast. And it's flawless.\n",

            "\"Twin Falls, Idaho\" is a very well made film with unusual depth and complex emotional content. It is absolutely a must see for anyone wanting more than your usual Hollywood fodder and fluff. A different sort of Love Story and a gritty look at a uniquely off-center topic. <br /><br />The Characters are often somewhat surreal, but not to the point of being ridiculous or unbelievable, this said same surrealism serves to make the imagery and story all the more powerful. The Hopeful and \"Best of Humanity\" themes and messages underlying the main story are clear to anyone that watches this fine piece of work. <br /><br />Casting and Cinematography are exceptional. And the stand out performance without a doubt goes to the lovely Michele Hicks as Penny as well as fine performances by Mark and Michael Polish as the Twins. One of the Best Films I have seen in quite a long time.\n",

            "A lot of good review comments, so I'll just add. This movie could well be classed a historical in some respects, and is actually shown in some colleges as part of curriculum. It is based on the true and personal story of Run DMC, The Fat Boys, Kurtis Blow, Sheila E, and others breaking out rap music for the first time to the mainstream audiences against convention and against those who would view rap as non-music and a fad. It showcases the music as a true underground phenomena; fun, creative, positive, and energetic; embraced by urban youth eager to rebel. Poor, fat, whatever, just being yourself for a change was enough for you to make a go of it and be successful. There are 12 musical productions in the film and some showstopper performances by Sheila E (coached by Prince for this film) especially. This movie was based on real events and the roles played by the people themselves who lived them. In that sense it may not have a Hollywood calibre cast and complicated plot, but that wasn't the point of this film. This film was meant to showcase the struggles of a music, the struggles of artists in an emerging genre, and show people where it was at in 1985. It did just that, capturing the heart and soul of hip-hop, where it all is rooted, free from excessive profanity, free from guns and gangsterism; just go out and have fun, stand tall, express yourself, forget the nay-sayers, and throw down the creativity. And the rest is history.\n",

            "A small US military group are sent to a deserted island to dispose any live bombs. When they get there, something not quite right. As they find out that they're expendable objects who would soon encounter one vengeful alien. Through an old hermit on the island they discover that this was a place where they kept an alien species and experimented on them. Not only they have an angry ET to face, but Military intelligence who plan to use them as bait.<br /><br />While, this is the third of the \"Xtro\" series, there's no relation between the three films. \"Predator\" heavily influences this tacky straight-to video Sci-fi fare. One thing definitely is that \"Predator\" is a definite masterpiece when compared to this cheap, hokey and pitifully vapid effort. Even the actors here, make Schwarzenegger look good! Very embarrassing execution, disastrously inept special effects and daft performances may you think \"Oh no. There goes another one of my brain cells\" when watching this one-of-a-kind piece of trash. The stuffy film is amateurishly put together with a clichéd narrative that's shamelessly derivative. Reckless characters act tough and spit out macho dribble with attitude. It's pretty mind numbing to listen to, especially when it goes for meaningful conversations. Streaming through is a husky voice-over and a lot white rabbits to hold your attention. Yeah, there's something engaging about those white fluffy rabbits!<br /><br />Despite finding it quite an irritable and drab viewing, few things hit the mark. There are some quite nasty moments when the rubbery alien decides it's torture time with some blood squirting. The thunderous music score manages a few chilling cues. While the performances are laughably hopeless, but Robert Culp and a slightly amusing Andrew Divoff are the odd exception. While, the make-up effects of the outer space visitor are questionable, it still manages to hold up for its tiny budget.<br /><br />Director Harry Bromley (who also directed the first two flicks) is really clutching at straws with this flatly handled and too practical project. Imaginative details, gripping suspense and bug-eyed visuals are long gone here. No techniques really stand out in this by the numbers exercise and what he comes up with is mostly ridiculous and ineffective.<br /><br />Poorly done garbage that turns into a wearisome puddle.\n",

            "That line as uttered by Richard the baddie after Jet Li's character told him he had been *Kissed* by the dragon was an instant classic!! Tcheky Karyo was a brilliant over the top villain!<br /><br />Now that's out of the way, My thoughts on the movie... First the story, It was above average for an action film, but I wont dwell on that because let's face it, No one goes to an action/martial arts film solely for the story. With that in mind, I will focus my comments on the action and martial arts sequences.<br /><br />On the whole, the movie had a dark sort of feel toward it and thus not as upbeat as Jet's previous Hollywood outing, \" Romeo must die \". The fight scenes were a welcome change to the wirefu seen in *Romeo must Die* and *Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon* and were grounded in reality, with Jet using various martial arts techniques modified for street fighting. <br /><br />This movie in terms of fighting would have been first rate if it weren't for the shoddy camera work and editing during most of the fights.<br /><br />Western directors MUST learn to pull back the camera and stop using those fast cut MTV style editing when it comes to shooting martial arts fight sequences. The first rule of shooting a martial arts scene,especially when the actor is also a talented martial artist, is to pull the camera back and shoot it with a wide angle with longer takes and not to do so many close ups with excessively fast cutting of scenes to the point where the whole body cannot be seen and consequently the FUlL power, grace and the execution of the technique is lost to the audience. <br /><br />But even with this flaw, the fight scenes still manage to be very entertaining, My personal favourites are The Dojo fight (where Jet utilises Fillipino Escrima stick fighting) and the fight with the 2 albino twins where Jet outnumbered and outsized by his opponents, uses his environment and his speed to defeat them. Those two fights in particular even though they are choreographed, look very REAL and are as hardcore as they come!<br /><br />Overall, Kiss of the Dragon is a decent action film with good action set pieces but due to the haphazard editing, The film cannot be used as a true showcase of Jet's Skill. One would have to go back to his earlier work in Hong Kong for that.\n",

            "I've always been a fan of the Terminator series, T2 was one of the first films I can actually remember watching as a kid and comprehending the plot. As I grew older both Terminator films stayed a staple of my sci-fi cinema diet and both are landmark films in their own right.<br /><br />Like a lot of people I was kinda bummed by T3, it was an okay film but a FAR cry from the first two so I was psyched for Salvation when I first heard about it, but as each successive trailer was released and the PG-13 locked into place I found myself worried that it would be a let down...<br /><br />As it turns out its not as bad as I thought it would be, the action sequences are thrilling and gripping, the plot isn't all that bad and there's enough violence to make it R-Rated-ish... The acting also turned out surprisingly well with Sam Worthington (playing Marcus) and Anton Yelchin (playing Kyle Reese) being the two stand out performers. I swear there were times I Anton looked and sounded exactly like Michael Biehn who played Kyle in the original film and it was that fact (as well as a few other homages) that kept the hardcore Terminator fan in me placated...<br /><br />But placation isn't the same as satisfaction, the film has its flaws, the bad language you'd expect in a post-apocalyptic world is suppressed by the PG-13 rating and Bale delivers an overly dramatic performance to a character we learn far too little about other than what we know happened to him as a kid... My other major complaint is the CGI used for the Terminators themselves, it really didn't look good and I found myself praying for them to go back to Practical Effects where things look solid and real...<br /><br />Remember how relentless the Terminator was in the first film?? Well that is carried over here, these guys won't stop until their processor is dead, but since they're CGI for the most part it lessens the feel of real danger... Somewhere deep inside the Terminator fan in me was wishing to return to that dark skull covered gritty landscape we saw glimpses of in the first Terminator (this definitely isn't the future Connor's Mother warned him about)<br /><br />Hardcore terminator fans might want to avoid this, it was better than T3 but still pretty far off the quality of the first two, still, if its a Summer Blockbuster you want then go see Terminator Salvation, you could do a lot worse...\n",

            "I had heard comments saying that this film was child pornography or something. That idea is totally wrong! The nude scenes where Violet (Brooke Shields) appears nude are only a few and pure, there is NO lascivious exhibition or anything similar. So please stop saying this is child pornography because it is not.<br /><br />---MAJOR SPOILERS---<br /><br />Anyway, I must say that most of the content, especially the first half, is disturbing because you can see how cruel was the social environment where the girl was living in. For example, they make her to prepare drugs for the old lady of the house, she is beaten, every woman keeps saying she will be such a beautiful revenue, she is allowed to see nudity and sexual intercourse anytime, and in general they do not handle her as a child, but as a servant and as a potential little whore all the time. The limit of sickness is when the girl's virginity is auctioned. Even her own mom agrees. At this moment you think \"Does someone there has a heart?\" It seems the only person that really loves her is the black pianist and you can see the indignation in his eyes during the auction, but he feels helpless cause he knows he cannot do anything because of his race.<br /><br />But the worst is that most of this abuse is being done with the little girl's consent and her WISH. You just cannot wait to break into the screen, take her and shout \"Wake up, baby, wake up!\" Somehow she realizes that no-one cares about her but on the other hand she wants attention and wants to be handled as an adult, just like all preteens want. Sadly the only way of life she knows to be an adult woman is to be a prostitute. But even though she wants to be an adult it is just like a game for her, because actually she behaves like a kid because she IS a kid. And at the finale is obvious how her innocence is still there when her mom comes back with a new dad for her and wants to take her to a better life, and she says to her husband/photographer \"Can't we all go?\"... The finale makes you think \"I hope Violet will have a really better life now\". Since her new dad seems to be a respectable person you would think she will.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film. It is cruel, raw, you have to be prepared to watch this. The bad points is that this film has a slow pace, it is predictable and the actors are not too good, it seems they are reading lines. But I give it 8 out of 10 because the plot is well done also the time scenery/clothing/atmosphere, and specially because it is a controversial theme handled deeply.<br /><br />If someone asks me \"Was Brooke Shields exploited in this movie?\" I have to say of course, she was, not only for the nudes but for the situations she has to go through the film. Even though the nudes in this movie are tame, they are nudes after all and I don't think a girl that age feels comfortable being nude in a cinema production set with 20-30 people around looking at her, not to mention the things she has to say or to do with men in the movie. But what can you do? She was exploited, just like other kids in cinema like Jodie Foster, Drew Barrymore, Shirley Temple and the most recent Dakota Fanning.\n",

The film paints a portrait of a troubled woman who descends into paranoid schizophrenia as the end nears all the while maintaining the unexpectedly undaunted, matter-of-fact demeanor of one very much reconciled to her fate in spite of being trapped in a system with no recompense for abuse in childhood nor insanity in adulthood who well may have been failed by the criminal justice system as well. A worthwhile watch for those interested in the Wornous story, especially as a follow-up to \"Monster\". (B)\n",

The actors seem lost, Jack Elam had one of the ugliest mugs in cinematic history, Joe 'Wooly' Namath hopefully has forgotten this monstrosity of a spaghetti western.<br /><br />This film is pure concentrated evil that should have been left buried in its infernal tomb, but nevertheless Encore/Starz felt it was necessary to force suffering on their ad-hoc loyal viewers.<br /><br />You will be in shock and awe that such a heap could ever have been made, i cant spoil the plot because there was none discernible in the mess of the Last Rebel.\n",

I learned a lesson that always look how many voted and also read all votes. There are so man other good Zombie movies out there then this one. <br /><br />They often use effects like 3 small windows instead of a big one some times and that ruined it a lot.<br /><br />Acting bad, story bad.

            "Let's face it , Qayamat is BAD . A supreme disaster . Worse , a complete ripoff of The Rock with unnecessary-yet-mandatory love interests and a truckload of songs all sounding the same . Harry Baweja has never been a good director and with this and Teesri Aankh , I have ceased to have any faith in him . Scriptwriter Suparn Verma was a Rediff.com critic and after you watch Qayamat you'll surely understand that critics don't necessarily make good filmmakers , and make horrible screenwriters .<br /><br />Plot : CBI Officer Akram Sheikh (Sunil Shetty) is after three dreaded Pakistani arms dealers - brothers Ali (Arbaaz Khan) and Abbas (Sanjay Kapoor) and their common moll Laila (Isha Koppikar) . After a botched arms deal , Ali-Abbas are left out in the cold with Akram closing in on them . They decide to steal a lethal virus from a top govt. lab where Gopal (Chunky Pandey) and Rahul (Ashish Chaudhary) are working . Then they take over the Elphinstone Jail and hold all terrorists as hostages . The location was used as a jail in the past , now it is a tourist spot . So convenient to lure unsuspecting visitors .<br /><br />Only one man in history has escaped Elphinstone Jail , Rachit (Ajay Devgan) is his name . Akram Sheikh asks Rachit to lead him to the secret passage into the jail , that is located below sea level . Then we learn of Rachit's past , how his GF Sapna (Neha Dhupia) was killed and he was reduced to being a vegetable .<br /><br />Rahul accompanies the commando squad since he knows how to diffuse the weapons . Thanks to the tipoff from a dishonest minister (Govind Namdeo) , the bad guys already know that the commandos are coming . They kill every commando on arrival , leaving Rachit and Rahul to complete the mission .<br /><br />Honestly this has so many plot holes , I would run out of words . I am sick of this continual and stereotypical Pakistan-bashing . It's like, \"We don't have any villains left , why not pick up the Pakistanis?\" and the makers go ahead . And Sapna was killed in the first half , wasn't she? Then how come she was alive and kicking in the second Half???!! Basically Sapna wasn't needed , the screechy Sheetal (Riya Sen playing Rahul's GF) wasn't needed (In fact this entire movie wasn't needed :) ) . As far as the drool quotient goes , Neha Dhupia does an Ursula Andress in a baby pink bikini for a few seconds in the song \"Dil Chura Liya\" , otherwise she is fully clad all the time . Riya Sen has skimpier outfits and a seductive song \"Yaar Pyaar Ho Gaya\" with Ashish Chaudhary . Isha Koppikar doesn't offer much in that department , but ends up having comparatively more screen time .<br /><br />The dialogues were cringe-inducing . Sample this, \"Sapna Ko Main Kabhi Haqeeqat Nahin Banne Doonga\" and \"Police Ki Maar Ki Baat Hi Nirali , Goonga Bhi Gaaye Qawwali\" :( . Performances were BAD : Ajay Devgan speaks very little (he knew this was going to be a waste) . Sunil Shetty , Arbaaz Khan , Sanjay Kapoor , Ashish Chaudhary are all horrible . The girls have nothing to do but flash their vital stats between alternately screeching and crying . This movie was talked about for its action scenes ; but they are very poorly copied from the likes of M:I , The Rock and others . And would Mr. Allan Amin tell me when will his obsession with slow-motion end? Songs are disappointing - Nadeem , Shravan and Sameer at their worst .<br /><br />The only high point is the stylish camera-work by Sanjay F. Gupta . But how come this became a hit ?\n",

            "This game is terrific. Even do this game is made for the game boy advance with all of the console's limits, is also extremely enjoyable. It is a very long and fun game with innovating stuff for the genre. Its story is really good as the characters are. But what is the difference between this RPG and others? It has magic.<br /><br />When you take into account that the game boy advance is not one of the best consoles out there, you would be a bit hesitant about this game. But I can assure you that all the good stuff totally make up for the system's limits. The fight are very well designed, the world is really big and you can find tons of monster to practice the moves. The sound is also enjoyable and the graphics are good for the game boy advance.<br /><br />The story is about a group of four adepts (The person who can use Psynergy) with different powers, who need to stop the bad guys from lighting the four beacons/seals and therefore break the alchemy seal that use to balance to forces on earth. The story is little more complicated than that since there are many sub-plots and you get to understand our characters and the bad guys actions.<br /><br />The new features included in this game are the Djinn, which are Pokémon like creatures (They need to be caught as well) with different powers. The difference is that there are only four kinds of them (Water, fire, wind and earth) which match each of the four main characters type. The main characters own special powers according to their type (for example the earth guy has powers related to earth and so on) which are necessary when you need to solve puzzles to beat the many different dungeons. You can set Djinns to each character to provide them with additional strength or you can also change types for them. The Djinn can be use in different forms in battle, you are able to use each Djinn special technique, or use a group of them to sum an even stronger attack. You can also use each character special power (They call it Psynergy) or simply attack the bad guys with your weapons. The battle system is really good as well but it would be a little long to explain.<br /><br />Overall this game is an absolute worth trying. Anyone who claim he/she likes RPG will love this title, and the rest will love it as well.\n",

            "'The Dead Next Door' is an ode to all things Zombie. A homage to Sam Raimi, Tom Savini and the great zombie-king George Romero; done on a next to nothing budget. Shot entirely on Super-8, and written, produced, edited and scored by J.R. Bookwalter; this thing looks and feels just like one would expect it to: Indie. I found the storyline to be about as entertaining as it could be. Zombies running amuck. Scientists trying to cure them by running tests (much like Romero's 'DAY of the Dead'), which end up being fruitless. Nice little original twist here too, a \"Zombie Squad\" who hunts down and kills them as in most zombie films, but this time they are roadblocked by a group of what appear to be leftist democrats trying to preserve the human rights of zombies. Haha. Not too far fetched in this day and age. Anyhow, this leads the Zombie Squad to a farmhouse outside of Akron Ohio, where an original group of doctors almost perfected a serum which could get rid of the problem once and for all, problem is now that farmhouse is inhabited by a cult of zombie worshipers, led by a Rev. Jones, no doubt a tongue-in-cheek dark homage to the madman Jim Jones of Jonestown fame.<br /><br />So it is what it is. A low-budget, ultra cheesy, terribly acted zombie gore-fest. By my standards of gore - my standards being Jackson's 'Braindead' as the godfather of gore for a zombie flick; 'The Dead Next Door' is slightly below average, but still having enough squirting blood and decapitations to keep me happy. Enjoy this film with some mates and a few pints.<br /><br />4 out of 10.\n",

            "Cannibal Apocalypse is an important Italian horror film as it marks the successful fusion of the two most successful Italian sub-genres; zombies and cannibals. The plot follows a vicious virus brought back to America by three soldiers returning from Vietnam; only it's not your usual virus. Instead of turning it's victims into mindless zombies; it leaves the afflicted aware of their situation, albeit with a hunger for human flesh. Cannibal Apocalypse isn't the movie that you would expect it to be. Even though it's been cut and banned many times, the gore isn't all that nasty, or frequent; with only a few sequences really hitting the 'disgusting' mark. The film is much more intelligent than the usual cannibal nonsense, as it explores themes such as Vietnam veterans returning into society, and turns the tables on Dawn of the Dead's social commentary. It analyses it's points with a sly grin on it's face, however, and it's clear that none of the points are being made with any real conviction; but Antonio Margheriti has shown with previous movies (Dance Macabre, The Virgin of Nuremberg) that he's too clever for merely making a movie about cannibals - and that's the main reason why Cannibal Apocalypse offers more.<br /><br />The film benefits massively from the presence of John Saxon. This hardworking and criminally underrated actor leads the film with relish, and adds massively to the final spectacle; even if the man himself refuses to see this film. He is joined by cult actor Giovanni Lombardo Radice, who has worked with many of the great Italian directors, including the likes of Lucio Fulci, Umberto Lenzi and Michele Soavi. The plotting of the film is well paced, and despite a few lapses; is generally exciting throughout. Tributes to Dawn of the Dead, along with Fulci's Zombi 2 are rampant throughout; the best, of which being a sequence inside a flea market - good stuff! Margheriti's direction is as assured, as you would expect, and even if he's not quite an Argento or Bava; he's definitely among the elite of the lesser-known Italian directors. The fact that this movie is mostly set in a city sets it apart from most of the rest of the cannibal films, which tend to take place in the jungle. On the whole, this certainly isn't one of the best movies ever made; but it's a lot of fun, and won't disappoint fans of Italian horror. Recommended.\n",

            "I found it hard to view the user comments on this film because of all the partisan ranting from demagogues of both parties. Therefore, I am going to try and leave my own political persuasions out of this review although I definitely have a viewpoint about what was happening in Iraq and the need for US involvement there.<br /><br />*** This may contain spoilers, although this is a simple documentary with no plot, so there ain't much to spoil.*** <br /><br />After all the hype about Michael Moore's slanted, biased, and intellectually dishonest film Fahrenheit 911, and all the celebrity hubbub about how George Bush is an evil so-and-so and our involvement in Iraq was simply about obtaining oil, I thought I might have a look at what the other side (who gets far less sensationalistic coverage in the national media) had to say about the whole situation. I had heard that this documentary was particularly brutal and difficult to watch, but I thought it was important to see just what was going on in Iraq before the US dismantled Saddam Hussein's regime.<br /><br />It was brutal, it was grotesque, and it was very difficult to sit through. We are treated to footage of people's arms stretched out across two concrete blocks and then being broken with axe handles; we see fingers hacked off, then the screaming, bleeding victim tossed aside to fend for himself; we see hands amputated surgically and tongues clipped outall these horrific atrocities committed by way of punishment in the name of \"justice\". We see torture, murder, and disturbing footage of women being publicly shot or stoned to death for \"crimes\" such as adultery.<br /><br />My problem is that the documentary, hosted by some boring, no-name yobbo in a suit and tie, frequently wanders from its supposed focus in favor of showing gruesome footage. At first it feels, albeit unpleasant, at least informative; however, as the film wears on, it becomes even more unpleasant, loses its informative nature, and begins to feel distinctly exploitative in tone. I found that shift in tone more disturbing than the film itself. The film ends with every videotaped beheading they could find. I had seen many when they were current news, believing it important to see what the enemy (terrorists and radical religious fundamentalists) was all about, but I just couldn't stomach re-watching these cold-blooded, grotesque murders again, presented as they were in the guise of \"infotainment\", and turned the movie off.<br /><br />In some ways this film shows some important things that were happening within Hussein's Iraq that folks like Sean Penn either didn't see or chose to ignore. It will make you appreciate living in a free country where you don't have your tongue cut out or your hands amputated for displeasing a mad dictator. The US got involved in Bosnia and Somalia based on concern for the genocide occurring there, how could we in fairness turn a blind eye to Iraq? Saddam Hussein actively and arrogant defied every UN sanction and action taken against him, including those he agreed to in order to end the war in 1991, but the UN clearly wasn't going to do anything about it, especially with corrupt UN officials making under-the-table deals with Hussein. Who else but the US would have taken steps to correct this injustice? These are all good points made in the beginning of the film.<br /><br />But the film's weakness is where it loses its focus on the reasons we went there and simply becomes a parade of gore, brutality, and murder. Although it has its good points, I can't in good conscience recommend it as a good, well-made documentary.<br /><br />Cheers <br /><br />Brent\n",

Also, the subject matter does not easily lend itself to breezy comedy, and most certainly does not the way it's treated here.

There are not many and as a rule they do not get to Hollywood and do not get any Oscars, though they may make their mark in Cannes, Berlin, Venice, San Sebastián.<br /><br />`El Sur'(1982)(qv) directed by Víctor Érice is one such exquisite gem; and in this film we have playing the part of Estrella, aged 15, Icíar Bollaín. Because of this I await anything she might now be doing, twenty years later. At last I have my reward: it has been worth waiting. Srta. Icíar has matured and is indeed herself a `flower from another world'. In this film we have proof of this. Ms. Bollaín, in common with a few other European directors, has chosen to make films of socialogical import, and this is well achieved in `Flores de Otro Mundo'.<br /><br />The script was co-written by herself and Julio Llamazares. This writer is well-known in Spain through hundreds of newspaper articles, letters, several books and so on. He is an ardent defender of rural Spanish life, which, over the last 30-40 years, has been declining, and indeed he lives in or spends large parts of his time in such places as the mountainous `Ancares' in the province of León, north-western Spain, or in the pre-Pyrenean areas of Huesca in the north of Aragón. Ms. Bollaín could hardly have found a better person for helping her with this film in the greatly depopulated central province of Guadalajara, north-east of Madrid.<br /><br />In the 30s, 40s and 50s Spain emigrated to Argentina, Chile, Mexico, France, etc. However, today the boats are turned  literally  and the country is now a receiver of immigrants. Indeed, rural areas of Spain have even been advertising for people to go to their villages with children so as to keep their schools open, or just simply advertising for women to be future wives for the unmarried men who remain working the land. Against this sociological background, Icíar Bollaín sets her film `Flores de Otro Mundo'  in this case Cuban and Dominican women  who arrive at a village lost in the sierras of Guadalajara. The film narrates the experiences of a group of these women, as all concerned, villagers and new-arrivals alike, suffer problems in differences in culture, opposing mentalities and concepts of life, especially over the issue of rural and urban life.<br /><br />Well-conceived and well-acted, the film is an excellent vehicle for conveying real human issues. The leading actors  such as the well-known Chete Lera and the Cuban actress Marylin Torres  are ably supported by the whole cast, as well as the real local people in the village of Cantalojas  baptized Santa Eulalia for the film  in the extreme north-west of the province, and where the film was given its first public showing! Some intensely dramatic moments are carefully combined with warmer human issues, such that the film achieves an endearing credibility. Take note of the scenes with `Janay' for example. Recommended film, though people learning Spanish might find some of the accents a little difficult at times. Well, the worst you have to do is bear with the subtitles; it's well worth your while.\n",

The movie is about so many things: Political Corruption, America's hypocritical puritanical stances on everything, anti-drugs legislation, sugar as the opium for the masses... you name it. <br /><br />More than anything... the movie is about old fashioned thrills, suspense, clever ideas and making the audience think while laughing. No doubt the film is truly silly and in no way believable - but once you suspend your disbelief and unbutton your shirt - ACNE really kicks in. I don't want to wreck too much of the plot - I hate when reviews do that. Let me just say - I've been waiting for a bizarre independent film with horror and science fiction elements to come my way for a good while... <br /><br />Note to the viewing public - this film has a very small budget - do not expect Hollywood style sets or slickness. From what I've read about ACNE - it cost $18,000 and was shot on film (amazing). So don't expect massive production values because you'll be cheating yourself and the film - buy ACNE wherever you get your hands on it. <br /><br />Jessica\n",

I saw the film as a fairly accurate portrayal of reality of being a possible-gay teenager (something about which I know first-hand).<br /><br />Possibly the best scene in the film is when Bobby comes to family dinner dressed in drag. Not because he likes drag, but because that is what seems to be expected. He gives his father a bit of justified hell.\n",

The acting on the part of Hugh Dancy is acceptable, as for Cook it is not up to the standard of her other performances. In all their character's relationship seems utterly unbelievable. Watching Melanie Griffith in Tempo though was a sad experience I could have done without. I remember her from films such as \"Working Girl\" were she was witty, funny and sexy. In \"Tempo\" she acts like she is wearing a mask. Her facial expressions are almost non-existent. Another fact that annoyed me with \"Tempo\" was the obvious lack of detail when it came to locations. The story is supposed to take place in Paris, why is it then that throughout the film, street signs are in German?? Even Munich does not look like Munich.\n",

            "The Public Enemy is a 1931 American crime film starring James Cagney and directed by William A. Wellman. The movie relates the story of a young man's rise in the criminal underworld in prohibition-era urban America. The supporting players include a young 20 yr. old Jean Harlow, Edward Woods, Joan Blondell, Beryl Mercer, Donald Cook, and Mae Clarke. The film, which was based on the novel Beer and Blood by John Bright, launched Cagney to stardom. A theater in Times Square ran The Public Enemy 24 hours a day during its initial release. It was the first worldwide box office hit for Cagney (age 31) and forever cast him in the public eye as a \"tough guy,\" an image he was unable to shed despite numerous roles chosen especially to counter that image, including his Oscar-winning role in Yankee Doodle Dandy. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. In 1998, The Public Enemy was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". I was impressed by this movie's frankness regarding the life of a gangster during the prohibition era.\n",

As much as us 'women' would hate to think we had a 'Jake' as our spouse, but realize we may have a 'Mickey', but really want to kid ourselves to think we could always roll over in the AM to see our 'Doug' - wake up and smell the 'monkey coffee'. I am married, with kids, a woman who had a career and gave it up for family and can still relate to the 'Mickey' character. I think people trash this show because it really does make them look at themselves in the mirror and ask yourself 'am I really happy with the choices I've made?' You then realize you are happy with what you have...you just have to remind yourself a couple times out of the day. I was totally disappointed when this show was cancelled - and hope somewhere down the line it will come around again.

            "\"Jurm\" is a film which is supposed to be a thriller, without actually being one. The film is very easy to predict, and lacks of suspense. Even though the film begins promising, it completely fails and falls in level afterwards. Vikram Bhatt is not able to maintain the suspense through out the film. The main problem with \"Jurm\" is that it has absolutely nothing new to offer. What you see has been seen several times before. On the top of that the chemistry between the actors is miserable as well. This is one of the few films where even Bobby Deol isn't able to play his part with conviction. Lara Dutta proves that being beautiful and sexy doesn't necessarily mean that you can act. Thank you! Gul Panag hasn't got much to do in the film. Milind Soman plays extremely artificially, and falls flat in front of Bobby Deol, in spite the fact that he is not playing well either. It is truly sad to see an actor of Ashish Vidyarthi's calibre to choose such a low level film, where he doesn't get the chance to play even 10% of what he is capable of.<br /><br />\"Jurm\" is a terrible film with terrible acting and has nothing new to offer. This one doesn't even qualify as being a time-pass movie.\n",

            "Yes, I saw this movie long ago in a time when the Science Fiction channel was one of my favorite channels. The showed lots of violent anime, classic horror movies, Godzilla movies, and my favorite show Mystery Science Theater 3000. Now I virtually do not watch the channel at all, sometimes pausing to roll my eyes at their newest giant computer generated monster movie. When movies are compared to the film \"Alien\", most are unfairly criticized for copying that film. In fact other than it is a horror in space a lot of these films have very little else in common with that film. This one, however, is very comparable to that film and to that of the underwater film \"Leviathan\" which itself does a bit of copying of the film \"Alien\". This one even more so as it has a kind of android in it that turns against the crew. In fact, the title of the movie refers not to the creature, but rather the android which is in the shape of a cat. Basically, a creature is going on the attack fusing itself a bit with those it kills and then you have your characters that are your normal rag tag group including a couple with hidden agendas. Unlike a lot of animes I have seen this one is more like an American cartoon in that it has a rather short run time which hinders the plot a bit, but all in all it is a fast pace sort of horror in space anime.\n",

The characters are interesting, with the main protagonist (Daniel Craig, actor) pondering love, along with other internal and interpersonal mysteries. This search at times puts his relationship with his significant other (Samantha Morton, actress) at risk. A compelling story combined with breathtaking cinematography, especially of the countryside, along with evocative music that follows the dynamic range from tuneful, haunting bucolic melodies to more strident dissonance, and profoundly natural and nuanced acting performances come together to craft an unforgettable cinematic experience. Rhys Ifans is an actor of Protean skill, and has a knack for choosing off beat and interesting roles, his role in this film being no exception.

Ellen Barkin is perfect in her role and she and Al Pacino light up the screen in several ways. John Goodman is fantastic and his performance helps a great deal, to the solid, good acted and plausible life story.

            "Couple the idea of New York as a maximum security prison with Kurt Russell's hard-bitten performance as one-eyed outlaw Snake Plissken and you've got another one of John Carpenter's contemporary classics. Nobody gets out of New York alive, it would seem; even the President of the United States... unless Plissken can haul his fat out of the fire. En route to the Chief Executive (\"President of what?\" Plissken asks at one point), there are downed planes and starving crazies who live in the sewers and old acquaintances hiding out in libraries and The Duke of New York (Isaac Hayes), whose army of ne'er do wells must be contended with. All within the allotted time: Plissken is literally a ticking time bomb, thanks to duplicitous Lee Van Cleef as the commander of the United States Police Force. For all its dark doings, however, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK is also infused with an often subtle black humor that helps keep it from devolving into the kind of lackluster action film that features stars who can't act; Russell as Plissken is also- surprise- vulnerable, and thence more real, than most action leads. One can't help but sympathize with his character. (And one can't help but think back to ELVIS, the amazing boob-tube biography directed by Carpenter with Russell in the lead: like ELVIS, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK delivers on an emotional level. One can't ask for more than that.)\n",

It was trying too hard. I felt disconnected from the film. I didn't care about the characters. It wasn't funny. I didn't feel the drama. No one really had a moment. I didn't feel for anyone. The filmmakers enthusiasm was there, but the choices didn't work for the story. These people are going to get better, they seem to have observed a lot of films. But I don't want to notice the camera so much. I want to be moved and so absorbed in the story that I don't think about how they are trying to manipulate my senses and feelings. The highlight of the whole screening was nothing. Because, as I said and will continue to keep saying, with this film, You Got Nothin'.

            "\"Death on the Nile\" is a most entertaining crime and mystery story based on one of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot novels in her classic \"who did it?\" style. But besides the plot this movie was filmed in beautiful and real Egyptian locations that make a great and unusual atmosphere all around. As usual in the \"Queen of Mystery\"'s plots some events occur too coincidentally perfect so that impossible situations and alibis become possible for the story's sake, but this was Miss Christie's trade mark and no doubt that she had a great imagination and skill to make most interesting and \"catching\" plots in the genre.<br /><br />Though Peter Ustinov doesn't fit physically with Chrisitie's description of her Belgium talented detective (a sort little insignificant man, bald and with an egg shaped head), Peter Ustinov has managed to be identified with the character with his classy and skillful acting. The usual star's cast playing the suspects that distract our attention in this one has the always reliable David Niven, the great Bette Davis, Mia Farrow, George Kennedy, Jane Birkin, Jack Warden, Jon Finch, Olivia Hussey and a magnificent Angela Lansbury (as usual). Lois Chiles is the spoiled rich heiress that is murdered under strange circumstances (she looks for it all the time).<br /><br />In my opinion and along with \"Evil Under the Sun\" this film stands among the best in Miss Chrsitie's novels movie versions.

            "A poorly developed action adventure film shot largely in Mexico, this affair begins in promising fashion, but after its first of several changes in direction occurs within the plot line, little remains that will interest a viewer. A group of international students (in reality organized supporters of anti-government rebels) is massacred in Colombia by Federales as action opens, while during alternating scenes Joe Wiley (Ryan O'Neal), an American electronics engineer, visiting Mexico to recover from a divorce, meets an affluent socialite, Lillian Holbrook (Anne Archer). When the two become romantically involved, a complicated situation forms since Lillian is being wooed by Meno Argenti (Omar Sharif), a powerful plutocrat who controls the emerald trade for the rotten Mexican government, thus leading to shared distaste between the two men. When Lillian travels to Colombia in quest of her missing younger sister, Joe goes with her, an act not endorsed by Meno who wishes to wed her for personal reasons other than love, and a climactic conflict between the rivals can result only in violence. The screenplay is a hotchpotch with a thread of intended light-hearted romance woven among such disparate themes as murder, torture and sadism, along with grotesquely silly stunts that Joe and his cohorts perform in attempts to foil the evil Argenti. The piece is heavily cut for distribution, and editing is very choppy, increasing the episodic nature of a script that consistently meanders, scenes honouring logic being very rare indeed. The players are somewhat hindered by their cliché laden lines, O'Neal being even more encumbered by a large assortment of electronic and other specialized equipment that is magically available for use in situations requiring derring-do. Camera-work under supervision from cinematographer Gilbert Taylor is strikingly effective and creative but general mistreatment of basic rules of continuity sinks this effort despite its pretty scenic effects.\n",

His one puppy-dog like expression seemed endearing in the first fifteen minutes of the movie, but later translated to simply bad acting. In his new movie, Prinze plays Al Connelly, a college student searching for love, among other things.<br /><br />When he meets freshman Imogen, played by the lovely Julia Stiles, he is immediately fascinated by her. Unfortunately, the audience doesn't get to revel in this too long, because ten minutes later they were sleeping together, and soon after that, acting like an old married couple. The movie chronicles their tale of first love, along with every obstacle in between, such as Al's friend who directs porn movies, and his father, who wants to start with a Cops -like cooking show with his son.<br /><br />At the beginning, this seemed like a wonderful idea for a movie. The first fifteen minutes were a sweet, almost realistic account of first love, which many people could relate to. A particularly endearing moment was when Al tells the camera, `I thought this would last forever,' after describing a romantic moment shared by the couple. However, all of the potential of this movie was shattered when all of a sudden, in a moment of 90210 like melodrama, Imogen thinks she's pregnant. Of course, this event is the beginning of their problems for the rest of the movie.<br /><br />The film continues its downward spiral, culminating an unrealistic and contrived ending. Prinze and Stiles simply had no chemistry on screen, and by the end, the audience was simply not interested in whether they got together or not. Prinze seemed incapable of showing any emotion, making his character extremely boring and just annoying. On the other hand, Stiles (of 10 Things I Hate About You) was charming as usual, but unfortunately stuck in a bad movie, with no place to show off her talent. Additionally, the supporting cast was no help, awkwardly put in scenes to make badly acted sex jokes, and having no relevant or even interesting purpose.<br /><br />Written and directed by Kris Isacsson, the movie had some good ideas, but those were quickly overshadowed by too much melodrama and contrived storylines. What could've been an earnest and sweet romance, turned into a boring story with annoying characters.\n",

            "This is a very funny and sad movie about two girls (Enid and Rebecca) just entering the real world trying to figure out what to do with life, just as Seymour, a middle aged man, struggles through his own life as he has trouble relating to other people. While Enid and Rebecca discover that life outside of high school isn't as great as they imagined it to be, Seymour (who already knows about the loneliness of life) tries for once in his life to actually start living instead of just floating through life. Steve Buscemi, who plays Seymour, has one of his most memorable performances, and Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson are perfect fits for their roles. Anyone who feels like they don't quite fit in with society will surely find something to like in this movie. There has never been a teen movie like this, and there probably isn't any that are better than this. And don't forget about the old man waiting for the bus. Could this old man have the answer?\n",

            "A king turned evil sorcerer from the dark ages is conquering civilizations and he has his eyes set on the Emerald land next. The home of the infamous 'Amazon\" female warriors. To stop this from happening, two Amazons Dyala and Tashi head out on a dangerous quest to retrieve the powerful \"Sword of Azundati\", which is the only weapon that could put a stop to this tyrant. But could a history between the two Amazon warriors' families hinder the important journey.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting a miracle from this chunky and bottom-of-the-barrel schlock of sword 'n' sorcery that was inspired by the commercial success of \"Conan the Barbarian\". Although I didn't think this Roger Corman produced, obtuse turkey was going to be \"this\" boring. How boring? Hugely dull and unexciting. And how's that? As you can't go wrong with a stunning lot of fur bikini clad Amazon women. Well, you would like to think so. T & A features constantly, and they like baring their breasts in regular intervals. Too bad about the rest of the feature and the great cover art on the video case disguises and promises more than it actually delivers.<br /><br />Everything else is pretty bland and pedestrian. Vividly magical and unique this fantasy world is not. From the flaccidly lacklustre fight sequences to its sloth-like pacing, which feels like its always-trapped in slow motion. This is caused by many irrelevant stoppages (naturally getting sidetracked) in the quest that makes the 87 minutes running time come across like an eternity. I'm just so glad there was eye candy on show. The acting by all is plain stiff and strangely well-mannered (!). Mindi Millar, Penelope Reed (who's character gets knocked out cold and caught in trouble a lot) and a titillatingly feisty Danitza Kingsley are scratchy, but do look fine nonetheless. Joseph Whipp takes the cake in the woodenly droll evil sorcerer who shoots thunderbolts from his fingers. Truly malevolent hell no! The special effects are as cheap and clumsy as can be (look at the transformation scene). While, the cheapjack cardboard sets don't add up much too primitive reality, but in all, these trusty elements were expected and were its charm.<br /><br />The drolly soft-centred story is the traditional set-up, and easy as it comes. Some oddly resourceful and quick marks shape its way into the jumbled material. The shabby script that suffocates the feature just doesn't matter here, as thinking about what they say will hurt your head. And who came up with these horrendously obscure names?! Oh right, you don't want your head to explode. Filmed in Argentina and directed by Alejandro Sessa. Nothing makes a huge dent, but there was one okay atmospheric piece, that went crazy with the lighting to go all spooky. Unfocusedly murky photography and being lampooned by a chaotically corn-riddled music score reminded me what I was watching.<br /><br />This fantasy sub-genre has its share of crap and \"Amazons\" deserves to stand along those titles. There are too little unintentional laughs that you would expect from this type of inept film-making. I wanted to enjoy this gloriously incompetence, but it had me yawning for most part.\n",

            "Nearly every review of a movie contains a so called spoiler, because otherwise it will be very hard to write about a movie beside the fact you have seen a movie. But anyway: this movie spoils itself in the very first minutes and show a hunter killing a deer, oops, a naked woman. Exactly this is the message of the movie: hunting humans like animals. Nasty premise. After this we follow a really nice girl on her way to become a prostitute to become at least the victim of the deranged hunter from the beginning. What will sound like a terrible exploitation movie is in fact a very clever handled mixture of drama and thriller, sometimes creepy, sometimes entertaining in the way of a self-parody. To make a personal commentary: the only reason for me as a film critic person since 30 years to write here for no money is the fact I want to push movies I like. End of Spoilers - have an entertaining and haunting evening with this not \"important\", but (in all departments from acting, writing to directing) very well executed chiller.\n",

            "I am a sucker for post-apocalyptic event films, and will cut them a lot more slack than other Hollywood fare. However, Dragon Head has made me very wary of ever returning to the genre. What a waste of celluloid. No story, no character development, poor effects, and a male lead who wanders about clueless from start to finish. Most bad films leave you bored or listless; with Dragon Head, I was shouting at the TV screen, it was so mind-numbingly stupid. <br /><br />Some kind of apocalyptic event has taken place while the protagonist was riding the train. What is this event? How did it come about? We are never told. How do the surviving male and female high school pupils come to terms with this event? They don't. How do they grow, mature and change through the film? They don't. They just wander from one bizarre scenario to the next (from a town where the youth have turned on their elders, to a bunker where everyone is eating drugged food) without any causal relationship between the stages of their journey or the events they encounter there. I suppose some kind of Lord of the Flies metaphor is implied by the boy-savage who menaces the leads in the first third, but without connecting this to WHY civilisation has ended and WHY people are reacting the way they are, the message goes nowhere. <br /><br />A script as poor as this should never, ever have been made. Sayaka is a good actress, as she showed with a nuanced performance in the short film Bean Cake, but even she can't salvage this. This film has no saving graces. Not a single one.<br /><br />It gets one star, because I am not allowed to give it zero.\n",

            "This has got to be the out there 'Most Awful' film of 1990. Someone suggested the 'Skipper' was asked to leave a 'West Indies' port, hence the cruise. This is wrong on 2 counts. The skipper is suspected of committing 'foul play' on a rival and sinks to the bottom of a bottle and the port he meets and is tricked into a cruise by the women in is obviously Gibraltar (old Morris 1300 driven by port officials, scene showing the Rock). They then set sail on what is a most turgid voyage. At one point Su (Patsy Kensit) steals the Skippers' (Jurgen Prochnow) insulin whilst her friend Lou (Elizabeth Hurley) protects her friend from his rage. I think after that I'd be looking for the nearest ship, island anything to get rid of them both! The finale comes completely out of character for Lou, a crime without motive that is frankly unbelievable and the final written statement makes it clear that whoever wrote this tripe had one too many misogynist nightmares.

The homework story made absolutely no sense (well, neither did the others), but this one wasn't scary. Now, Shilpa's story was just crossing the limits. It was absolutely ridiculous!

They were really good and would have given a break. The ending was absolutely stupid. This movie was more bizarre than anything else.

This movie gets better with watching.<br /><br />When I first watched \"Milk Money\", I initailly squirmed when V and Tom were talking. V is talking about sex, and Tom is talking about math.<br /><br />Another point people might squirm is when a mother thinks Tom and V are brother and sister, and mentions to her children them as a good example. Then Tom kisses V in a way most people think brothers and sisters should not kiss. The kids are grossed.<br /><br />In other areas, it is a very good movie. In a gentle, and comic way, it deals with boys interest in sex and girls. It is done with the right balance. The boys all seem to be normal boys, in spite of the fact that no one has a \"normal\" family life. Who does.<br /><br />For instance, one of the boys is a neat freak because of his father, who unknown to him, has real issues. Later, he decides to stop washing. It's an overreaction, but there is truth when the father blames (wrongly) Tom for turning his son into a pig. Tom says at the boy is happy. He doesn't say it, but it is implied unlike before.\n",

            "...I'd rate this fourth out of the four I can think of. As Australian post-apocalyptic movies featuring Kurt Cobain's ghost go, Freedom Deep is A-number-one!<br /><br />So I watch bad movies for fun. That's my excuse. After reading the back of the DVD's packaging, which contains the phrase \"we see how his talents are nutured (sic) and developed under the guidance of his spiritual mentor - 'Kurt Cobain,'\" how could I not buy it? I could not not, that's how. There's another misspelling in the quote above I'd love to reproduce, but IMDb automatically corrects it every time I try.<br /><br />Freedom Deep takes place mostly in two time periods, between which it alternates: 1998-ish and 2018, with a little bit of \"much later\" as well. The nineties bit concerns a young boy named Liam, who has trouble at home and trouble with the other children at school. And, come to think of it, trouble with his teacher at school, a fact which is revealed in an inadvertently hilarious scene. The other prominent timeline focuses on an adult Liam (who, it should be noted, looks absolutely nothing like young Liam) who basically wanders around the desert a lot. To spice things up, sometimes he wanders through the snow. At one point, in a radical narrative departure, he manages to wander in a boat.<br /><br />Not sold on it yet? Just wait. The best part is that no incarnation of our protagonist, not young Liam, adult Liam or even old Liam, speaks a single word. Not because they're mute, but because it's, y'know, artsy. There's some voice-over here and there, but even that's sparse. I believe it was 28 minutes into the movie before *any* main character actually spoke a word to someone else, and that was through a headset to an unknown party. It's all about as enthralling as it sounds.<br /><br />Freedom Deep is a mess. It's Gordian's Knot, and I have no idea why anybody tied it. So there's this woman. She's a bounty hunter. Or an assassin. Or a government agent or something. I guess it's possible she's from the future of the future. I couldn't tell you. It's 2018, civilization's presumably in crumbles, and for completely unknown reasons she's been tasked with finding Liam wandering out in the desert. Liam's probably wandering the desert to get away from the society that wronged him, except I think that society has been destroyed for close to 20 years at this point. Maybe whatever society sprung up in its place picked on him too. Liam's had it rough. Anyway, she shoots a camel, finds her quarry, has a confusing wireless conversation, burns her headset, rapes Liam at knifepoint (!), they fall in love, and he never says a word. Your typical boy meets girl, really.<br /><br />All the while, she reads through the pages of a book Liam has written. It's the same book Liam started writing back in the 1998 timeline. One would hope that's a helluva book. And clearly it is, as she decides to spare his life because of it; she's convinced it must reach civilization.<br /><br />Meanwhile, young Liam runs away from home and manages to find a surrogate family in the form of a gay couple, half of which is a transsexual \"mother\" and the other half of which really likes heroin. Liam escapes his troubles, as he always has, through his love of plaid shirts, a horrendous hair-do, Kurt Cobain, and lots of music that sounds nothing like Kurt Cobain's. Music rights cost money. Soon he finds another outlet for his pain (pain best represented in voice-over by the heartfelt words \"heal my wounds\"). Poetry!<br /><br />The movie states that young Liam's story starts in 1998; we're told no more. Liam endures school and home life, escapes from it, finds an odd replacement family, takes up writing, gets in a series of publications, and becomes well-known enough to get into a meeting with corporate bigwigs who'd like to put his column in their magazine as a regular feature, all by March 12th of 1998, the movie tells us. Even assuming the rest of it started on January 1st, that little dude can move.<br /><br />I have no idea what to make of this movie. I didn't mention how Kurt Cobain really fits in because, well, he doesn't. Why does anyone care what a pubescent mute thinks, at least enough to publish him? Who is sending someone to catch and possibly kill adult Liam? Why? Who does our almost-assassin talk to on her headset? Why does she burn the thing afterwards? Are there wireless towers or satellites after the nuclear holocaust? What the heck happened with the cliff scene? Why does the word \"prophet\" keep popping up in reference to this movie? If Liam arrives at what looks like a fully intact city at the end, was it really harmed in the first place? Is he just some nutjob wandering around the desert for years and all the rest is his hallucination? Why did the writer-director think he could get away with three versions of a main character who never utters a word? I'm baffled.<br /><br />It's not the worst movie I've seen (I've given out a whole lot of one-star ratings), but it's bad. And it might not be the most confusing movie I've seen, but it's at least top five. As bad movie fare goes, it's entertaining and maybe worth a watch, but isn't a must-see crappy flick experience.<br /><br />In conclusion, let me present a condensed version of what the experience of watching this movie was like:<br /><br />Me: Wait, what?<br /><br />Roommate: I dunno.<br /><br />Me: Rewind it.<br /><br />(Rewind.) (Watch it again.)<br /><br />Together: What?<br /><br />(Repeat.)\n",

Not only are there punches to the groin, kicks to the groin, and paddles to the groin, there are even chopsticks and metal spheres to the groin! If, on the other hand, you're looking for something with a little more comedic value then men being hit in their nether regions, avoid Balls of Fury like the plague.<br /><br />The plot, which serves no purpose but to string together a multitude of lame jokes, follows Randy Daytona, a 12 year old ping pong prodigy, who is sweeping the ping pong world by storm. Unfortunately he ends up losing an important match, becomes a laughing stock and his father, who was involved in illegal gambling, is murdered.<br /><br />19 years later, Daytona (played by third rate Jack Black wannabe Dan Fogler) is washed up and performing ping pong tricks at a run down theatre. FBI agent Ernie Rodriguez (George Lopez), who has been assigned to take down Feng (Christopher Walken), a criminal mastermind who runs an underground ping pong tournament, decides to enlist Daytona to help take Feng down. Daytona, besides making a comeback in the ping pong circuit, wants to get his revenge on Feng, who incidentally, was responsible for his father's death. So Daytona and Rodriguez go undercover, infiltrating Feng's annual ping pong tournament, where they...get hit in the balls.<br /><br />There are two very confounding things about Balls of Fury. The first being how a script so utterly bad was green lit and produced. The movies plot doesn't make a lick of sense and ambles on from one random scene to the next. In one moment, Daytona and a female ping pong master are shown as hating each other...and out of nowhere, a minute later, they are suddenly love interests. It would've been nice for the writers to put a little bit of effort in and at least include something leading up to that. Another scene has Daytona refusing to join Rodriguez in taking down Feng, only to learn that a water park has been built next to his father's tombstone. How does that provide any motivation for Daytona to strive to take Feng down? The answer is it doesn't, as the writers were to busy writing in jokes to develop a good story.<br /><br />This wouldn't be such a big deal if any of the jokes were actually funny. Sadly, half of the jokes either involve testicles or an old blind man walking into things, or in some instances, a combination of the two. It's not funny unless you're 12 years old (I wouldn't be surprised if the writer actually was). Not only are the jokes unfunny, they've been done hundreds of times before and done much better. When Balls of Fury does manage to include some original jokes, it involves stuff like the aforementioned water park being built next to a tombstone, which sadly enough, is less funny then the blind man falling down a staircase.<br /><br />The second mind boggling thing about this movie is how they managed to stick Christopher Walken in this film as the villain, Feng. There are a few other relatively known actors in here, but Terry Crews has already been making appearances in terrible movies for a while now (Norbit anybody?) and Maggie Q still hasn't become a house-hold name. But Christopher Walken? Walken is an amazing actor and it's a crime to see him act in crud like this. He's been in a few duds in the past (Envy springs to mind), but he's never sunken to this level before. Walken isn't fading out or losing appeal, in fact he just had a role in the critical and box office hit, Hairspray. How could he read a script that terrible and agree to take on a big role as the villain? The only reasonable answer seems to be that director Ben Garrant blackmailed him into taking it, as I've got to much respect for Walken to believe he'd actually willingly agree to.<br /><br />Walken manages to get a few laughs, which is an impressive feat in a movie like this, and steals every scene he's in. Despite working with crummy material, he still puts in a decent comedic performance as Feng, far outshining the other actors. Dan Fogler is the least funny leading man since Jimmy Fallon and mugs for the camera every opportunity he gets, imitating Jack Black as best as he can. George Lopez and Maggie Q play their roles completely straight, which doesn't work in a movie so absurd. By the end of the movie, you'll be wishing they axed the main characters and just made a movie about Feng instead.<br /><br />The tagline for Balls of Fury reads \"A Huge Comedy with Tiny Balls\". On the contrary, it took a lot of balls to make this movie. It took balls for director Ben Garrant to release the film without Alan Smithee in replace of his name in the credits. It took balls for Christopher Walken to act in this trash and risk losing his credibility as an actor. It took balls for Rogue to screen the film for critics, as if they expected any good reviews. Yep, it took a lot of balls to make this movie. What it didn't take to make the film was any talent. Balls of Fury is a horrid excuse for a film, and if you're looking for a funny movie to see in the theatre, go see Superbad or Hot Rod. Hell, you can even go see Halloween, as a film about a serial killer is bound to be more funny then this trash.\n",

            "This film is ostensibly about the overfishing of sharks and what that may mean for shark populations and marine ecology, but within the first few minutes of the film you realize that \"Sharkwater\" is largely about writer/director/producer Rob Stewart and how heroic and unique he fancies himself to be. One of the first sequences is a long shot of a bronzed, shirtless Stewart strolling along a tropical beach, fresh from a snorkel, while the narrator (Stewart, naturally) describes how he's always loved sharks, always been fascinated by them, blah blah blah. <br /><br />Now, there's nothing wrong with liking sharks. I was a passionate elasmophile as a kid, and I cultivated that interest through a biology degree, a shark research internship, and various fisheries-related jobs both in the U.S. and abroad. In the age of Cousteau, \"Jaws\", National Geographic, and the Discovery Channel, there have been tens of thousands of shark fanatics, and indeed there has been a sea change in popular opinion about sharks. The evidence of this is everywhere, despite the mainstream media's steadfast insistence on maintaining the more sensational and macabre elements of shark attack news coverage. But somehow Stewart has convinced himself that his interest in sharks, his efforts to conserve them, and his perspective on shark mythology are unique and profound whereas most people (except for Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd staff) are ineffectual morons still clinging to myths of sharks as vicious maneaters. This is both wildly ignorant of the last twenty years of shark biology and conservation efforts, and insulting to the many people around the world who are more experienced and knowledgeable than Stewart. <br /><br />What's more repellent than Stewart's delusional lone-savior persona (reminiscent of Timothy Treadwell in Werner Herzog's \"Grizzly Man\") is that he felt the need to insert himself into his film to such a stunningly narcissistic degree. The climax of \"Sharkwater\" comes when Stewart is laid up in a Central American hospital with what he describes as a life-threatening case of staph infection, or \"flesh-eating disease.\" We see him lying in bed--I'm guessing it's a reenactment, as he's wearing a clean orange polo shirt, not a hospital gown--phoning his mother to assure her that everything's going to be okay. He's looking grim and bummed out, but he's still tanned, well-coiffed, and is obviously thinking about the camera that's on him. What happens next? Stewart literally wills his infection away so he can go back to Costa Rica, back to Cocos Island where the film began, to help his beloved cartilaginous friends. I'm not kidding. And neither is Stewart. His love for sharks simply defeats the bacterial infection that had threatened his life and limb. <br /><br />Okay, I thought. Surely there's got to be some good reason for Stewart to be going back to Costa Rica, where he's wanted by the police for his involvement in Sea Shepherd's altercation with a fishing boat illegally fishing for sharks. Surely it must be vital to the narrative of this film for him to will away (!) a bacterial infection that supposedly was going to claim his left leg. Surely he's going to firebomb the illegal shark-fin processing plant or sink the shark-finning fleet, and that'll justify all the effort. I mean, there's gotta be some kind of payoff... Right? <br /><br />Nope. The reason Stewart has to get back to Cocos is...to go for a swim with sharks. In a Speedo. I'm not kidding. The final sequence shows our hero freediving (he lowers his heart rate to 40bpm so that the sharks will not be afraid of him) in a banana sling with some sharks. Why was this so important? Who knows. Stewart seems to think that simply communing with sharks (which in an earlier scene includes grabbing hold of one and lovingly stroking its flank) is helpful to their cause. Again, this kind of behavior is eerily familiar if you've seen \"Grizzly Man\" in which Tim Treadwell says \"I love you, I love you, I love you\" to several indifferent bears. And there's plenty of pedestrian talk about the \"balance\" in the seas, and how sharks have been \"gods for 400 million years,\" with ludicrous design-oriented language about how sharks have shaped the evolution of the seas. This is high school level stuff. <br /><br />I'll give Stewart some credit--hence the rating of 2 rather than 1--because he assembles some compellingly gruesome footage of shark finning (and beheading and gutting) to drive home the point of finning's barbaric, wasteful nature. There's also some pretty HD footage of whales, turtles, sharks and other charismatic marine megafauna, but nothing we haven't seen before in \"Blue Planet\" or other productions. But even the lush scenery is spoiled. Several times, Stewart actually turns his camera around underwater so we can see him, as though his presence amongst the sea's inhabitants is itself vital to the \"balance in the seas\" that he longs to preserve or reestablish.<br /><br />\"Sharkwater\" could've been an objective, hard-hitting exposé of the shark finning industry and an investigation into the complicity of corrupt government. Instead it's an accidental study in self-aggrandizement and amateur science.\n",

            "One of the earliest Japanese animation films I can remember seeing, this film was a perfect introduction to me in how great a textured and visually appealing an anime story could be. Shot like a noir detective film with all the action and speed of a spy thriller, this film set a new benchmark for the sniper/hit-man genre. <br /><br />Duke Togo, while devoid of most emotion, captivates as a steely and ruthless assassin bent on survival as well as completion of his tasks. The stylish and dark film has conspiracies, presidential assassinations, serial killers, sex, guns, explosions and insane escape scenes. <br /><br />The story is straight forward; someone has paid Golgo 13 to assassinate the son of a wealthy business man and oil magnate. Revenge is to be taken on Golgo 13 at all costs, involving crooked cops, serial killers, generals, CIA, FBI, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Special Forces. Basically, Leonard Dawson is taking his son's death a bit hard and feels just a little raw toward Duke.<br /><br />The American translation is passable with pretty good over all emotional tone and great music setting for mood. One of my favorite anime and overall examples of noir style in graphic arts of the 80s if you can ignore that very dated helicopter scene that makes everyone so angry... Personally I didn't think it was bad, just out of place in a film with a perfect fever pitch already. Great ending, great film overall. Well worth a look for anyone who enjoys spy films, hit men or noir.\n",

            "After a bunch of early films where Robert Taylor was playing both modern and costumed romantic leads, taking full advantage of his extraordinary good looks, Robert Taylor asked for some more rugged type roles. Louis B. Mayer's answer to his most cooperative of stars was to cast him first in A Yank At Oxford and then in The Crowd Roars.<br /><br />In the first film, Taylor rowed crew for dear old Oxford where he was a matriculating student. But in The Crowd Roars he's even more rugged as a boxer. The role was chosen for him so he could have lots of opportunities to go bare-chested and show that in fact he's got hair on his chest. Taylor himself made that comment and back in those more innocent days it was to show he was not a powderpuff as if having follicles on your anterior was proof of that.<br /><br />Overlooked in this hairy situation was the fact that Robert Taylor got a very fine role for himself as a boxer determined to make a quick buck and get out as fast as possible before becoming a punch drunk rummy. He's had poor and he's had rich and rich was better. Back when he was poor he was living hand to mouth with a near do well father, Frank Morgan, and a gentle mother who took in washing because her husband couldn't hold down a job. Taylor's mother in The Crowd Roars was played by Emma Dunn in a brief, but very telling role.<br /><br />Anyway when young Gene Reynolds grows up to be Robert Taylor he's now supporting dear old dad who's still drinking and gambling. Those two habits are nearly the undoing of his son when he falls into the hands of rival gamblers Edward Arnold and Nat Pendleton. The usual bumbling oaf that Frank Morgan portrays on screen is played far more serious here. It's one of Frank Morgan's best screen roles.<br /><br />Arnold has his secrets also, his daughter Maureen O'Sullivan and her ditzy friend Jane Wyman think Arnold is a stockbroker, as if that wasn't also gambling. Taylor in courting Sullivan does not disillusion her.<br /><br />Look for another good performance by William Gargan as a former Light Heavyweight champion who takes an interest in young Gene Reynolds and Lionel Stander as Gargan's trainer and later Taylor's trainer.<br /><br />The Crowd Roars is a fine film from MGM that went a long way in expanding Robert Taylor's range as thespian. <br /><br />And we proved he had hair on his chest.\n",

            "Rarely have I enjoyed a film this much when I also found so much wrong with it. The biggest reasons for liking Irina Palm are Marianne Faithful and Miki Manojlovic. They are terrific, both humble and genuine in their roles of hand-jobbist and sex-club owner, respectively. I hesitate to call them prostitute and pimp because that would grossly overstate their actual vocations. It's gross overstatements that slightly mar this otherwise delightful film about a woman who, apparently, stoops to a pretty low standard in her efforts to save the life of her gravely ill grandson.<br /><br />I write \"apparently\" because I couldn't help but conclude from this film that giving hand-jobs for a living is not all that bad. Maggie (M. Faithful) receives the moral high ground in her confrontations with both her friends and her son when the truth of her vocation is revealed. Her son makes a fool of himself, vastly over-acting and over-reacting when he discovers his mother working in a sex club. He sees her dressed in a typical day dress walking through the club. All the other women are half naked, but her son concludes that she is working as a whore. He calls her a whore, screams it at her without a single question. As the audience, we see this display of ridiculous emotion as misplaced. Maggie's daughter-in-law, who up to this point didn't seem to care if her son lived or died, rises to the defense of her mother-in-law. Maggie entered this degrading lifestyle to save her grandson. That's what is important.<br /><br />Maggie finds strength and a new, authentic life in refusing to accompany her son and grandson to Australia, and instead returns to the sex club and kisses (and presumably falls in love with) the sex club owner, who, in response to Maggie's declaration that she likes his smile, affirming their budding closeness, says \"I like the way you work.\" Gracious me.<br /><br />Dorka Gryllus is also wonderful as the young veteran of glory hole work. But after developing her character, and her relationship with Maggie, she is abruptly tossed aside. The two of them had become friends, but Louisa (D. Gryllus) is unrealistically fired because, apparently, Maggie has taken away all her clients. On her way out, Louisa curses Maggie who has no idea why. When Maggie later approaches Louisa at her home in a run down housing project (isn't that where you'd expect a glory hole worker to live?) to attempt reconciliation perhaps, Louisa opens up a can of class-consciously aware worms in response, but then is shut out, turned off, and eliminated from the rest of the film entirely.<br /><br />The script to Irina Palm (palm, hand-job, get it?) has to have some tongue planted firmly in cheek. For those who are curious, there are no penises shown in the film, only arm movements and careful camera angles that suggest the size of the unseen units must average one to two feet in length. The rise of this mild-mannered, fifty-year-old grandma who can't even say the f-word, from nobody to the \"best right hand in London\", with men in long queues to receive her services is absurd. It's just not that kind of skill. It's a very small segment of a larger talent pool.<br /><br />Maggie wears her right arm in a sling for most of the film, suffering from \"penis elbow\", which is akin to tennis elbow only from a different vocation. Enjoy the film. Don't sweat the details of this simple and touching story, just soak in the wonderful performances amidst the (inexplicably chosen) mildly raunchy milieu.\n",

The film is very well done but apart from that, I think it shouldn´t disappoint any fan of horror, it has everything that a good movie of the genre must have, including great amounts of blood, a very good rhythm and effective actors such as Pam Grier(Jackie Brown), the muse of blaxploitation genre from the seventies, a genre which is paid homage in this movie as well as some classics of the genre such as \"Hellraiser\" or \"Reanimator\", although the introduction of the comic element paying homage to that movie was for me the weakest element of the whole(it broke the so tenebrous atmosphere).Finally, director Ernst. R.Dickerson who also directed the not so good but entertaining \"tales from the Crypt: Evil Knight\" assured that this movie had elements from Italian horror cinema, I don´t know but perhaps there is one: The warms.A homage to Lucio Fulci?, I know there is many homages here but it is the same for other movies and the cocktail is far from being so effectively combined as here.I don´t think they are going to make a sequel, but I am looking forward eagerly the next movie from this director and I wish \"Resident Evil\" was so satisfactory.\n",

            "\"Filme da Treta\" is inspired in a previous work called \"Conversa da Treta\", which can be translated as \"Blather\" or \"Foolish Talk\". In fact it all begun with a radio show (with that name) where two friends, \"Toni\" and \"Zezé\", talk about their lives and their neighbourhood (located somewhere in a typical district of Lisbon!). Because of the colloquial and comic language it used to be funny. Then it passed to the stage (kind of a dialog play) and later to a TV-show.

            "\"The Wild Geese\" presents a terrific concept, a cast of well-known players who work well together, and crisp cinematography by Jack Hildyard that takes full advantage of the sun-bleached African veldt. So it's a disappointment the filmmakers couldn't make something worth watching.<br /><br />Based on a novel by Daniel Carney, \"The Wild Geese\" presents Col. Faulkner (Richard Burton), a hard-drinking soldier of fortune still shaking off the pain from losing good-guy African leader Julius Limbani (Winston Ntshona) to a cruel dictator years ago. But Limbani remains alive, and a British tycoon offers Faulkner big money to get Limbani out of prison and to safety.<br /><br />Burton looks about ready to keel over, but he's still Burton, convincing in his command, and he's backed up by Richard Harris, Roger Moore, and Hardy Kruger as his officers. Alas, the film never gels. Director Andrew V. McLaglen, good in the 1960s at marrying action-adventure and comedy, seems lost playing to a grittier '70s sensibility, and with a script that presents the mercenaries with one bloody setback after another. A message of racial brotherhood is advanced by Ntshona and Kruger with some jaw-droppingly bad dialogue, as Kruger's South African character, Coetze, drops his deep-rooted racism after a few minutes of carrying Limbani on his back.<br /><br />\"We need each other, white man, and that's the way it should be,\" Limbani says.<br /><br />\"You're beginning to sound good to me,\" Coetze replies. \"Maybe we need you. Maybe you're just the man.\"<br /><br />Coetze's transformation is way too pat. Also pat is the way a fort full of soldiers is eradicated in broad daylight by spraying cyanide into a barrack full of sleeping soldiers. In broad daylight? <br /><br />Things don't exactly purr along for the mercenaries after that, but even the complications feel forced and unnatural. So do Moore's trademark groan-inducing witticisms and a homosexual medic played by Kenneth Griffith who flounces about the mercenaries' training camp and writes out a will leaving everything to his proctologist.<br /><br />Pluses include a key plot twist in the middle of the film and a sequence when Moore drops his smarm long enough to make a mobster eat a bag of heroin at gunpoint. Harris and Burton have such good chemistry its surprising they only worked together this one time. And the film makes decent use of a deep supporting cast of top-flight Brits, including Barry Forster, Jack Watson, and Stewart Granger as Faulkner's steely employer.<br /><br />But you know you are in trouble in the first minute of the film, when rocker Joan Armatrading tries to channel Joan Baez with an utterly tuneless ballad while a 007-ish title sequence flashes up images of suffering Africans. Never mind most of the suffering Africans we see thereafter are the guys being shot to death by Burton & crew - it looks like McLaglen had the same eight guys get shot over and over to save money and hoped no one would notice. \"The Wild Geese\" promises two-fisted entertainment, but what you get instead too soft-headed to work on even the shallowest of levels.\n",

The key to understanding and enjoying this film is knowing what it is: a sexy and violent movie adaptation of a video game! Things move fast, the animation is awesome, and it is pure eye candy! This is definitely testosterone theater. If you are looking for theme heavy, weighty intellectualism, with a deep message and all that, you won't find it here.

It is pure frivolous fun, which is why it can't be compared to Akira, Ghost in the Shell, etc. Its just as good, but very different.\n",

            "When I first saw this movie it was my first look at either Wallace Beery or Jackie Cooper. I found both of them very interesting to watch. I also found out why Bob Hope and Jack Benny used to make a lot of sarcastic lines about \"being about as pretty as Wallace Beery.\" He definitely had an ugly \"mug.\" However, he was a lovable loser, at least in this film.<br /><br />Cooper played \"Dink,\" a cocky little kid who just loved \"The Champ\" (Beery). On the VHS tape, Cooper's squeaky little voice did not come across well and often was annoying to hear.<br /><br />The boxing scenes were hokey but I liked the ending because at least Beery won the fight, although he collapses afterward. I believe he lost in the re-make of this with Jon Voight and Ricky Shroder in the 1979 film, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />The kid's devotion to the champ, even under the toughest of situations, was touching. With clearer sound and picture, I would have kept the tape. I should check out the DVD.\n",

            "I was pleasantly surprised by this film for its guts to take a story and almost present it all through Demi Moore talking to two police detectives(Harvey Keitel and Bille Neal) in a room - everything we see is via her character's thoughts and perceptions and ideas of truth and untruth and is entirely in flashback form. The story centers around Moore and her friend Headly recently married to a brute of a guy played by Bruce Willis - and goes from there to murder, mystery, and the eventual uncovering of what is the truth behind everything. Director Alan Rudolph does a good job creating a story convincingly told throughout by flashback and from the first person whilst coming back to present time repeatedly. This is not as easy as it sounds and has been messed up in other films, but it does work here because of Rudolph's sure directorial talents and the acting of Moore, Willis, Headly and Keitel. Demi Moore gives perhaps one her best performances(looking lovely I might add as well) as a New York woman torn between several things. Headly is as strong as is Willis. All of the actors give serviceable performances and the whole movie looks and sounds like a spin off from The Sopranos or something the way all of the actors walk, talk, and act. You will have no doubts where the film takes place to be sure. The story is inventive and delivers at the end. I didn't see it coming but others could believably so - but even if that is the case the film works on other levels as well. There are some nice psychological examinations made in the film as well as challenges made to perceptions. I must agree the title is really quite horrible and has virtually nothing to do with this film, but all in all this is quite a good thriller that needs another look.\n",

            "In the movie SCARFACE, Tony Carmonte (Paul Muni) takes Rinaldi (George Raft) and his other gang members for a night of culture - they go to see a play. Carmonte has cultural pretensions, loving to whistle opera arias from MARTHA and other works, usually just before he has someone rubbed out. But he really likes RAIN, and Muni ends up sending his stooge, Vince Barnet, to watch the conclusion of the play while Muni and his gang rub out Boris Karloff. Barnet catches up to Muni later and tells him that \"Sadie\" chose the Marine rather than the \"cloth\" (Minister). Muni likes that, and says \"That Sadie is one smart girl.\" It is not the only time a classic film comments on the play RAIN. In TWENTIETH CENTURY John Barrymore compares another character's behavior to that of the Reverend Alfred Davidson (the Walter Huston performance in this film version).<br /><br />RAIN was considered (in the early 1930s) the greatest stage play since Shakespeare's HAMLET. Certainly it is an engrossing story, based on a short story by W. Somerset Maugham. It's ironic that the play, by John Colton, was not written by Maugham as a a play. Maugham was a successful West End dramatist, whose works are still revived on occasion (in 1990 I saw Glynis Johns and Stewart Granger in a revival of Maugham's comedy THE CIRCLE). But his work was better when he had the leisure to write descriptions of characters and their behavior, or of the settings of his stories. It's his short stories and novels that people still read, not his plays. And RAIN is the only one with any dramatic power - and it wasn't his play.<br /><br />RAIN is set in American Samoa, during the rainy season. A ship lands there, and among those who disembark are Rev. Alfred Davidson and his wife (Beulah Bondi). Both are extremely straight-laced - and apparently happy to be so. Davidson is annoyed to see that the hotel/store owner, Joe Horn (Guy Kibbee) has allowed a \"wanton\" woman named Sadie Thompson to room with there with the Davidsons and Dr. and Mrs. MacPhail. Thompson entertains a large number of American soldiers in her room, and she enjoys playing jazz on her Victrola. Except for the Davidsons, everyone else accepts Sadie. She's really a very friendly young woman, and she makes friends easily. As Mr. MacPhail is a philosopher, and Horn is of a philosophical turn (he keeps reading Ecclesiastes and Nietzche) neither of them really see anything wrong with Sadie.<br /><br />But Davidson is angered by the sinful woman. He has a way of throwing his weight around viciously through his missionary contacts in Washington. Soon he has the soldiers restricted to their barracks, including Sgt. O'Hara (William Gargan) who really cares for Sadie. All protests from MacPhail are ignored (Davidson smilingly forgives the Doctor for his misguided condemnation). Then he turns his attention on Sadie, and forces her to explain why she is the South Seas (it is a criminal matter she is fleeing in the states). He insists that she has to face the criminal charges in order for her soul to be purified. Sadie tries to fight it, but the pressure is too great.<br /><br />However, Davidson's contact with Sadie destroys him. He succeeds in turning her into a true penitent (as he imagines one), but he has become lascivious towards her - and finally has sex with her (we never are sure that it was voluntary or rape). When he realizes what he did, Davidson kills himself. Sadie ends up with O'Hara.<br /><br />The acting in this film was first rate. Because it lost money, Joan Crawford always dismissed it, but her smoldering sexuality bursts every time she appears (Lewis Milestone sets up entrance for her twice in the film which is very suggestive of a \"predatory\" woman). Huston is equally good, especially as the self-admiring, Pharisaical Reverend who sees nothing wrong about pulling political wires to save a soul (or sending that poor person back to face a probably hellish experience that he would never suffer through). His sudden revelation of sexual desire is a little overdone, but not too badly. The supporting characters like Bondi, Kibbee, and those who really see the power-lust in Davidson (Gargan and Kendall Lee, who is MacPhail) give very good account of themselves in the film, as does Walter Catlett as the ship purser who is a friend of Sadie's. If not a perfect film, it is a worthy one. I only hope that one day the Gloria Swanson version made in 1928 shows up so it can be compared to this one.\n",

            "The Puppet Master series is comprised of really awful movies featuring really cool puppets. The puppets, who sometimes are shown moving in stop-motion animation (very cool), are neat little killers each with their own little gimmick. The series' best entry was part three (\"Toulon's Revenge\"), but the following two installments were undeniably terrible, so it should've come as no surprise that I hated this, the most recent film and sixth part of the series.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this is directed by the same guy who directed part three (the best) and was edited by J.R. Bookwalter (I've never seen it, but apparently his film \"The Dead Next Door\" is pretty good) it is really, really boring. The characters are uninspired, the sets are run of the mill, and the killings are non-existent (despite one okay moment when Tunneler drilled a guy in the crotch. I guess the only good part of the movie was inspired by America's Funniest Home Videos).<br /><br />Worst of all, the puppets hardly ever make an appearance, and when they do they are obviously being held up by just-out-of-the-frame stage hands. There's hardly ANY stop-motion animation. I was also disappointed that Torch, one of the cooler puppets, was not in the film, even though he appeared in the credit sequence (which was a montage of footage from the previous movies).<br /><br />In short: Don't see this movie. It stinks!\n",

And is he the right man to lead the remaining members of the Troop? Directed by Joseph Newman, the films photography comes from Carl Guthrie, screenplay is courtesy of Martin Goldsmith, it's filmed in CinemaScope with De Luxe colour and the co-star list contains Forrest Tucker, John Russell, George N. Neise & Susan Cabot.<br /><br />A moody and tough psychological Western that showcases the truly good side of the \"B\" Western splinter. Thematically strong with its anti-racist core, and really tightly written by Goldsmith, it's also notable for containing a wonderful performance from McCrea. Tho his Western output was very hit and miss {the brilliant Peckinpah film Ride The High Country was to come 4 years later} McCrea was always value for money in even the tardiest of Oater's. Here he gets to really grizzle for all his worth, his Vinson is a bitter man, blinded by hate, yet still capable of softening up if engaged in the right conversation. McCrea is first rate in the role, never over doing the hard-nosed side of the character and garnering believable sympathy when his guard is down.<br /><br />More known for being the director of This Island Earth, Joseph Newman is hardly the name one links to the direction of a psychological Western. Yet he does a surprisingly good job with the action sequences and rightly lets his actors just tell the story. There's a small complaint that the final battle is all too brief, but that's a touch offset by a hillside C Troop/Apache battle that takes place in the first third of the film. Briskly constructed and with no saggy male posturing to weigh it down, the battle shows Newman to be quite adept at crafting a good old fashioned fight to the death between two very old fashioned foes. The film also looks terrific. Tho sadly not having a DVD release and therefore not getting a remastered work over, the current print of the film available to television networks is still a treat in this High Definition age. Where once the print was apparently murky, you now should be able to adjust and reap the benefit of what is on offer. Filmed at three locations, Gallup-New Mexico, Red Rock State Park-New Mexico & Kanab-Utah, Carl Guthrie's photography really utilises these locations, one moment it be a beautiful sprawling landscape, the next the rocks are enveloping the characters to portray the tension and confinement of their emotional and physical journey. All given the De Luxe sheen as the browns, reds and uniform blues come vividly to life.<br /><br />Fort Massacre is little known and certainly under seen, thus its reputation has been founded by the casual Western viewer entering into it unaware of what type of character driven film it is. It's hoped that it can now find a newer and more appreciative audience because it's one of the better B Westerns of the late 1950s. 8/10\n",

These lurkers were ghostly figures that hanged around the apartment building and only she saw. While, playing with friends the skipping rope strangely finds itself around Cathy's neck with little concern from the other children. Then a mysterious lady shows up and everything goes back to normal. Then we skip 15 years into the present where Cathy is in a relationship with a photographer, Bob. They're happily in love, but there's something lurking under the surface and Cathy starts getting recurring nightmares of her traumatic childhood.<br /><br />Roberta Findley might not have a great rep behind her films, but surprisingly I enjoyed \"The Oracle\", which made me grabbed this particular flick. The shame was that I didn't quite get into this shonky trash, despite an interestingly offbeat concept. Sadly I found it quite tough going as its terribly talky without really going anywhere with the idea. Sure, chat is fine, but when it strings you along and along with even more lifeless chitchat. The overall silliness of it shows up strongly that your hoping it would break out the madness, but it hardly eventuates. When it does. It's not for long, and back to pointless chitchat we go. Throw in plenty of redundant build-ups and odd stretches that fill like nothing more than fillers to pad out the running time. This only dragged out the slow pace even more. It should have been more fun than it was, as I found myself to be either bored or baffled.<br /><br />The plotting of the flat story was a convoluted jumble (It skips in between a whole lot of elements) with many uneventful happenings. It's a nasty little item that doesn't explicitly show it, but it's grim and mean-spirited in nature. After a genuinely creepy and tight opening couple minutes when Cathy was a child and throw in some motherly love. Some inspired touches creep up here. It never seemed quite sure where to go and its poor execution shows it up immensely. The look and feel of it is quite amateurish and it can't seem to shake it or work around it without embarrassingly telegraphing to us.<br /><br />Now it's better to leave the moronic script alone! While, the overwrought music score is quite a groaner and like something that would fit nicely in a silent film. The only real component technical aspect had to be that it was actually pretty well shot and caught the grimy locations. The acting was very indifferent and Christine Moore in the lead role was the only one to give a reasonable turn. Roy MacArthur had a bit a fun with his performance and lightened it up when on screen.<br /><br />This forgettable, drab feature definitely squanders every opportunity to make something fulfilling out of this idea.\n",

MacLaine and Hopkins do their best with the material but not even their considerable acting talents can save this. Every single event was predictable and boring. Also Derek's complete lack of acting talent is almost painful to watch. I don't care how beautiful she is--the woman just can't act! Hopkins hatred for her comes through loud and clear.<br /><br />This did nothing for the stars careers. Derek already had \"10\" out and Hopkins had \"The Elephant Man\" but MacLaine did this and another dreadful \"comedy\" called \"Loving Couples\" at the same time. She did point out in her book that they were both awful and almost ruined her career. Good thing she did \"Terms of Endearment\" a few years later.<br /><br />I had blocked this movie out completely but I saw a bit of it on TV recently and all the bad memories came rolling back. Also if you're just watching this to see Derek nude it happens during the opening credits and that's about it. A really bad film--1 all the way.\n",

            "This wartime comedy is one of Laurel and Hardy's first movies for Twentieth Century-Fox, so it isn't nearly as consistently funny as the ones they made at MGM. However, I found this to be very amusing and enjoyable, with many good laughs. The first half is very slow, but once they get involved with their Sergeant Hippo, it picks up a lot. Try not to laugh when Stan shoves a crow down Ollie's pants during an inspection, or when Stan and Ollie are forced to build a pontoon bridge (I liked Stan's choice of wood). All in all, this movie is ten times better than any of the comedies they come out with today and is definitely worth any L&H fans time. 8 out of 10.\n",

            "You cannot find many movies of this genre that are worth seeing, usually because either the screenplay isn't that good or the actors performance is bad.luckily, in this movie everything works like a clock.Peter Ustinov gives us another great performance as he did in \"EVIL UNDER THE SUN\".The rest of the cast are not bad but some could have been a little bit better. The screenplay is very good but sometimes it loses control and the movie becomes a little bit boring, especially at the beginning, until the first death. To sum up, this is a movie that you see only once{knowing the plot ruins the whole movie that's why i'm not telling you it}, but is a thriller that everyone should see. I give it 10/10.\n",

The images are as stunning as any by Vittorio Storraro and the story is ultimately uplifting and hopeful as it details the lives of Argentine exiles trying to survive and move on with their lives while in exile in Paris.

            "As hard as it is to troll through all the years of terrible films I've seen, I do not think it is unreasonable to say that House II is the single worst movie i have ever seen. It was worse than the first one even.<br /><br />The film starts semi promisingly with a couple moving into a massive mansion, which looks like a castle. In the middle of the night Jess can't sleep, so he gets up and wanders around. After hearing a sound, he explores, and the dud jump scene ruins any hope of some good horror. From this point onwards the film becomes awash in the sort of feeble storyline and bad acting that leaves the audience screaming in frustration. The plot flies follows no apparent path, and the action leaps from pre-historic settings, to Aztecs, back to reality, to the wild west so quickly that one wonders how the film received funding at all.<br /><br />The reason I did not give this film 1 out of 10 is because it did have some moments of comedy, both physically and verbally. Unfortunately there is absolutely no horror, and what little comedy there is quickly falls flat. This film is a waste of both the $1.50 per month rental fee and the 88 minutes spent watching.\n",

Like that terribly overrated skateboarding flick Dogtown And Z-Boys, this is a barrage of information that you didn't care to know, delivered by people sometimes visibly salivating at the prospect of recounting a story that isn't really worth telling.<br /><br />Many of these subjects are so rigorously determined to mythologize this period of Aussie film-making, that they end up telling tales that make them look like a smirking misanthropy collective. Wasn't it funny when that actress nearly drowned, just because some schmuck of a director couldn't get the shot that he wanted? How about when Henry Silva, an actor petrified of heights, almost p*ssed himself with fear because a camera crew took him 70ft off the ground without warning him? And that Etc sequence in Patrick? They considered giving the actor real shock therapy! What lovable rogues! What tw*ts.<br /><br />Stir in the endless shrugging off of numerous instances of casual racism and misogyny, and you're left with a pretty empty document of little genuine significance. <br /><br />There are a handful of interesting, level-headed contributors (one of them being an uncharacteristically restrained Quentin Tarantino) but there is no form, structure or analysis of any cultural impact that this movement may have had. Which is a shame, because such analysis may have justified the film's existence. <br /><br />There may well be valuable things to say about this subject, but it'll take a much more ambitious director to do it.\n",

            "I have read \"In the eye of the storm\", John Groberg's book about his mission to Tonga from which this movie was taken. Although, as is almost invariably the case, the book surpasses the movie in almost every important detail, \"The other side of heaven\" was nevertheless an enjoyable movie that was well made, with a good cast and outstanding scenery and effects.<br /><br />In most respects, the movie was quite faithful to the book, and the only knock I have is that it seemed to shy away from anything that could not be explained in a worldly way. Although people who are not members of the Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day Saints might be sceptical of the ability of a missionary to heal the sick, I think that it is important to depict a true story in its truest form, and John Groberg truly worked miracles in Tonga. I think that the majority of believers in the world (and most critics seem not to be!) believe in miracles, whether they be through a young mormon missionary or any other faithful follower of God, and I think this would have only enhanced the story. Granted, since Hollywood was funding it, they probably have a different opinion then I do! One notable exception in the movie was when he was sinking in the water after they jumped form the boat in the storm, and it seemed that a hand came and pulled him up, but no one was there. Although it was not clearly stated, I think they were insinuating that the Lord was helping him, and it was nice to see they didn't ignore that aspect altogether.<br /><br />Anyway, aside from all of that, it was an enjoyable movie that I think the whole family can watch and marvel at the difficulties people can face, and overcome, in their lives if they have the courage to try.\n",

I know that Billy Bean quit baseball to come out of the closet, which begs the question to the producers, \"Why are all 3 of the male \"stars\" gay?? Do they have something against heteros? Plus the \"stars\" are often very inappropriate with the contestants.

Can they get any cheaper?? Cripes! They should should get that at the very least for appearing, especially having to deal with the no-talent, no-name \"stars\".<br /><br />Bill Dwyer is OK, but does not take control of his show. He should watch some of the old game shows, and see how people like Garry Moore, John Daly, Bud Collyer, and Allen Ludden did it in the old day. They dominated the show, and they showed their talent and skill in always being able to reign in the stars as necessary. (Not that Mr. Dwyer has any of those to worry about.) This show had great expectation and falls super way short. Too bad. If the panel members..... oops, I mean stars, would stop being so all over the place, and be a little more respectable, they might make the second season...<br /><br />Right Now, however, this show belongs on the cancelled list, and I hope it is soon.

            "This is a film so perverted and completely unpleasant, it at times becomes a freak show. It's also hard to follow at times, and leaves a lot of loose ends. A beautiful but disturbed young woman inherits an abandoned whorehouse owned by her disgusting pervert uncle. As she uncovers the mostly gross secrets of her uncle's life and building, she begins to lose her mind under the strain, though someone in the background might be after her, as well. The characters are all messed up and impossible to really care about, and I found myself hoping that the building would blow up and kill most of the supporting characters. But one has to give credit where credit is due. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives an excellent performance as a young woman traumatized by some mysterious events in her childhood, even though no one will be surprised by what that trauma is when it's revealed. Leigh actually makes one feel for her character and root for her. Also helping somewhat is that the film has some style going for it, with slick cinematography and a few suspenseful scenes. It's just too bad these merits are wasted on a story that wasn't worth writing, let alone filming and charging admission for.\n",

Cynthia Preston was good as Ali and I liked Blu Mankuma's role as John. Adrian Paul did a very decent job in his part as Brady. Christopher Lloyd was wonderful and his thoughts were how I felt through out the movie. Several scenes made no sense at first and I am not sure that some ever did make any sense. It is definitely a psychological thriller and I felt like it gave me lots to think about after it ended even though I felt as though I was missing something during the movie.

            "Mid-twentieth-century historical dramas are worth a look for the sumptuous sets and costumes Hollywood studios might provide, plus their big casts might draw in accomplished character actors. Columbia Pictures' low-budget style unfortunately leaves Mask of the Avenger wanting in both areas. The best sets are brief backdrops of Austrian sailing ships approaching the Italian coastal towns, but most of the action takes place on familiar California riding trails or in formulaic European-looking interiors.<br /><br />The cast is disappointingly small and stereotypical, with one grand exception: Anthony Quinn as the corrupt military governor LaRocca. He makes a stock villain painfully comprehensible and overshadows the film's wan protagonist, Captain Dimorna played by John Derek. Their final sword fight looks like a total mismatch in LaRocca / Quinn's favor until he obligingly steps into Dimorna's blade. (In partial defense of Derek, I appreciated poster William Giesen's sympathetic review of Derek as a miscast character actor.) <br /><br />The only other attraction derives from the story's origin in a Dumas novel I haven't read. The town has a statue of \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" with the late Count's sword in a glass case in the statue's plinth, which DiMorna brandishes in an effort to convince the townspeople that he has resumed the Count's battle on their behalf. Beyond that, the film may be interesting as a late specimen of the swashbuckling genre, threatened with extinction by the rise of television and the decay of the studio system.\n",

As usual Gary proves able to sculpt a sympathetic protagonist who is able to win over the audience into rooting for him regardless of the sometimes violent methods he uses to defeat his foes and here his vengeance against the criminal fraternity who destroyed his family and friends is nothing short of apocalyptic.As well as the superb physical skills that Gary brings to his performances he is capable of portraying strong human emotions also.He is always very effective indeed in scenes involving children and it can be no accident that he is often cast as a father in his films.Martial arts are absent from this tale until the final thirty minutes and when they finally appear in a series of brutal and superbly well choreographed fights you realise that you are watching a master at work.There are simply no current screen martial arts stars (Chinese,European or American)who could have brought what Gary Daniels brings to this role.This is a movie that should be sought by anyone who professes to enjoy action and if they enjoyed it half as much as I did then it won't be long before they seek out other Gary Daniels movies.They won't be disappointed,if anyone working in this genre delivers the kind of energy that Gary Daniels does in every role then they are being very quiet about it.Keep the British flag flying Gary for there isn't any young actor in the UK today who looks as if they even have the strength to even lift the flag up.Only the US is capable of producing a movie like RECOIL and long may they continue.\n",

            "(Almost) Every horror movie has its degrading sequels, and Child's Play is no different. Well what can I say, if you've seen the original movie you probably realize what this sequel is about. Chucky the killer doll, with the inhabited soul of a madman, is back again! And he's angrier, and more sadistic, and wielding more corny one-liners than ever. All Chucky fans remember that he was burnt to a toasty crisp in the first movie. However in order to dispel rumors that Chucky ever came to life, the business that makes the Good-Guy Dolls decides to preposterously rebuild him, and show the public nothing is wrong with the doll. When they do this, Chucky comes back to life and sets out to find Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent). The kid he needs to voodoo in order to come back to life as a human. Chucky finds Andy in the hands of his new foster parents Phil (Gerrit Graham) and Joann (Jenny Agutter), and a stepsister Kyle (Christine Elise). Andy realizes that Chucky is after him, but as always nobody believes the youngster. Until the crazy, psychotic doll begins running out of time to turn human again, and sadistically murders anyone in his way of Andy.<br /><br />First things first, the original Child's Play is a campy classic, Child's Play 2 is not. Whereas the original had a way of composing itself with fine suspense and acting, which helped shut out the corniness of its doll-come-to-life plot. This utterly puke-inducing sequel has no way to take itself seriously at all. It happens in a lot of horror films with a lead slasher. Freddy Kruegger fell victim to crappy one-liners, Jason Voorhees turned out to be a frady-cat loser as a kid (Freddy Vs. Jason), and even Michael Myers got his butt kicked by Busta Rhymes. The only slightly creepy thing about Child's Play 2 is the ending, which takes place in the Good-Guys Doll Factory. But that can't save this ludicrously over-the-top slasher sequel. The acting is mild, the script only gets creative with the kills, and even the kills are more unsettling than scary.<br /><br />The few parts where Chucky kills somebody go too far over the top, to the point where you almost (or may) laugh at them. While they were a bit creative, I was repulsed by them in every imaginable way. There is a random, grotesque kill where Chucky pushes an innocent man onto a conveyor belt, and he is killed when doll eyes are punched into his face. It's scenes like this that, while creepy, really cross the line. Horror fans may enjoy a movie with nasty kills. But for me there has to be something to back it up, or it's just a senseless kill. I think it's absolutely disgusting how Hollywood glorifies murder on screen nowadays. It's only gotten progressively worse over the years after Child's Play 2. This review is being written in 2008, and the theaters are filled with Saw, Hostel, and more torture, torture, torture! I don't understand why people are so intrigued by gore. What fascinates audiences so much with it that it makes big money in ticket sales? A person gets killed on screen and there's no tragedy, but yet everyone gets upset and mourns when someone dies in real life. There's a word for that and it's called \"Hypocrite\".<br /><br />Child's Play 2 is an awful horror film. The poster art is scarier than the movie itself. Chucky did not deserve to have a horror series because in my opinion he's one of the worst horror icons since the evil killer Leprechaun. However I do have to give it points for its eery, creepy \"playtime\" atmosphere (such as the doll factory scene). I give Child's Play 2 a 1 out of 4. It's a gruesome 84 minutes, and for me it was too inhumane and it just wasn't worth it. Child's Play 2 was followed by 3 more sequels...Oh brother!\n",

            "If you see Birth, go in realizing it is an art-house film, not a mainstream thriller. If it didn't have Nicole Kidman in it, this film would be playing in less than 10 theaters in the country. But because of Kidman, it is playing in your local cineplex but this is not a film for the cineplex crowd. If you are looking for something like The Others, The Sixth Sense, or Ghost; do not see this film. <br /><br />Birth is a film where atmosphere means more that dialog. This is not a fun film. The people in the film are very deadpan and do not smile; especially the child. Much has been made of the bath scene but that is actually one of the least radical parts of this film. The thing that will upset most people are the long close-ups without any dialog. Also, the conclusion does not tie up as many loose ends as a mainstream film. This film wants the viewer to think about it afterwards.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman and Lauren Bacall are great but for me, Anne Heche almost stole the film with her small part. Also, the music is atmospheric and a real treat if you like symphonic music.<br /><br />This is a beautiful film to look at and listen to. The story will keep you guessing which direction it is going to go. Whether you are happy with the outcome or not will probably depend on your expectations. Go into this film with an open mind. 9/10\n",

            "Gregg Araki's film, \"Nowhere\", is a joke. It is pointless, superficial, and sometimes perverse. But it is a funny joke. It is a one-track, one punch-line film, and its degree of success can really be measured in how long it manages to sustain that joke  to keep it all at once interesting, intriguing and (above most other things), funny. If you're looking for answers or messages within the subtext of this film (and I use the term \"subtext\" lightly), then you will probably not find much in the trashy, nihilistic jerks who populate this trashy, nihilistic vision of LA. What you see is what you get; there is little subtly (\"God Help Us\" a large sign cries at one point while the main characters cheerfully ignore it). And yet somehow, despite most odds, Araki actually manages to construct a film around interesting, affectionate characters, and then pit them in an environment of illicite sex and drugs, disillusionment and disaffection, all while maintaining a level of pathos that (for the most part) is genuine. This is not an easy balancing act to achieve. To its credit, it manages to sustain this act for almost all of its 87 minuet run time.<br /><br />\"Nowhere\" seems to borrow heavily from the literature of Bret Easton Ellis. Its characters  racy and ridiculously attractive 18-year-old LA yuppies, disciples one and all of pop-tart culture and rejectors of the status quo  could be lifted from the campus of \"Rules of Attraction\", or the drunken house-parties of \"Less Than Zero\". (Frankly, this film could almost be the film adaptation of \"Rules of Attraction\"  and honestly, this film does an infinitely better job of communicating the undiluted themes, ideas and characterisations of the novel than the actual film adaptation managed). Like \"Less Than Zero\", the plight of central character Dark seems to begin and end with who he's sleeping with, who he'd like to be sleeping with, and who he realistically can sleep with  all the while looking for a way of bettering himself in the belief that unconditional love should not mean loving everyone with a pulse just for the heck of it. Unlike the central character of \"Less Than Zero\", Dark doesn't have a comparison to this life on which to better himself  like the rest of his friends, he makes do with that he has: drugs, sex, and a video camera.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, centres of a bunch of hedonistic and supremely superficial teenagers, all of whom have various attachments with each other, and appear to search (with varying degree of conviction and success) for an emotional connection with another human being. Some take advantage of the world and their place in it  others are taken advantage of. Some try to make sense of it, others to ignore it, and even more opt to simply go with the flow. In the space of 12 hours, a penultimate party will be attended, relationships will be tested, changed, negotiated and destroyed, and some of them will die. All of them are curiously bisexual, which does nothing to serve the narrative except to throw a few predictability curve balls into the narrative drive. This is hardly a criticism  while still on the unpredictability drive, Araki even throws in a large reptilian alien, just to see what happens. (Think \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" and you'll be on the right track).<br /><br />While my plot summation may seem somewhat conventional, this film is far from convention. Araki's film is like a more literal adaptation of any of Ellis's novels. What his characters don't say about themselves physically he depicts for the audience in saturated colour, surreal sets and staging, and impossible lighting effects. (The walls of each character's room are a fantastic projection of themselves: in one, Dark, our pseudo-protagonist, has a massive mural of himself holding a gun to his forehead; on another, a suicidal rock'n'roller has angry lines of text printed endlessly around the room). The film looks like one big drug-induced nightmare of colour and light and is strangely beautiful to look at. To say there is a hallucinogenic mixture of extremes would be a colossal understatement.<br /><br />And, come to think of it, his characters are themselves reflections of these extremes: from the almost stoner-drawl of Dark to the palpably naïve, virginal Montgomery, to the insanely Bonnie/Clyde antics of Shad and Lilith and over-the-top pairing of dominatrix-like personas Kriss and Kozy Araki's characters are almost parodies of themselves. And, with all good parodies, we laugh at them as well as with them.<br /><br />The film is very funny, a little shocking (but not for the reasons you'd assume), genuinely surprising (in a sick, twisted, predictable kind of way) and wonderfully frivolous. Looking for any great answers to universal questions in this film would be like trying to draw blood from a stone. It assumes to be nothing more than it is, and assumes that the audience does, too. It is an ensemble piece, and all of them are good. In the end, it is a deliberately trashy, superficial throw-away film that won't enhance the quality of your life or make you a better person. But what Araki also manages is to elicit an emotional response from his audience, even amid all this hyperkinetic chaos and frenetic drug-fuelled sex.<br /><br />Even though he may take us down familiar roads and into slightly unconventional territory, \"Nowhere\" remains a stubbornly unique vision of youth and pop-culture. I, for one, found the ending both touching and hilarious  it's the ultimate punch-line to the one, big joke. But it's a joke you either get, or you don't.<br /><br />***1/2 out of *****. That's ******* out of **********.<br /><br />Sure there are alien abductions, but man, take a chill pill\n",

Unfortunately, the former is given the short end of the stick in this irritatingly static production which spends an undue amount of time indoors. Mitchum tries hard to hold the film together, but although he plays the main character, he has the least footage. Beulah Bondi and Philip Tonge dominate the action to such an extent, they tend to push the other players off the screen. Only Mitch can stand up to them but he disappears for long stretches. Despite her second billing, Teresa Wright is hardly in the movie at all. Diana Lynn is better served by script and director, but the best performance is delivered by Carl Switzer as an aged Indian.\n",

The whole story about a bank robber who finds his calling in a much different sector of the spectrum made it an entertaining film. The acting is superb by the three main characters which really helps flesh out this story to the point that you really care for the characters. Paul Hogan plays a likable con turned good guy, his real life wife Linda Kozlowski plays a church/charity worker for disadvantaged kids who has a heart of gold and lastly kudos to Elias Koteas whose portrayal of a disabled guy gives the movie the heart and emotion that I must say I didn't expect.

            "I'm usually pretty forgiving when it comes to romantic comedies, especially those out of Hollywood. They often are borderline insipid, clichéd, predictable, and dull-witted, but those that aren't completely inept still manage to entertain to varying degrees. Unfortunately, \"My Mom's New Boyfriend\" falls way below the grade and fails even at being mildly amusing.<br /><br />First, it isn't necessary for a movie like this to be smart or particularly realistic, but it should have some integrity so that we can actually believe in the characters. Here, in the prologue, we see Henry Durand (Colin Hanks), who clearly has a close relationship with his Mom, Marty (Meg Ryan), leaving home and Mom behind to start a job with the FBI. Flash forward three years, and Henry returns home -- apparently, without even once having visited or talked to his Mom in all that time. Now I'm sure the FBI requires a certain amount of secrecy, but it sure doesn't require its agents to cut off all communication with their nearest and dearest for three years. Right off the bat, the phoniness of the set-up sinks any chance at viewer empathy with any of the characters.<br /><br />Second, the characters themselves are about the most unlikeable I can think of in any romantic comedy I've ever seen. I'd rather spend a weekend locked in a cell with Barbara Stone (Bette Midler's character in \"Ruthless People\") than 15 minutes with the insufferably egotistical, vapid Marty Durand. Ryan is just awful here, and I usually enjoy her performances. She badly overplays Marty's zany qualities with ticks and vocal histrionics that are way over-the-top, and she seems to have lost whatever limited gifts she had for physical comedy. Maybe the knife slipped and the surgeons cut something else out when they were redesigning her face. She looks like she's trying to look like Michelle Pfeiffer and failing miserably. It has to be the worst performance of her career, and probably the worst of the year. Hanks, perhaps trying to counterweight Ryan's annoying performance, is as lifeless as a paperweight. He glowers and scowls through the film. Neither Antonio Banderas nor Selma Blair have enough to do to make much of an impression, though Banderas manages at least to be somewhat charming through the muddle of the storyline. Actually, the only genuinely funny performance in the film is from Trevor Morgan, in a small part as a young stud Ryan dates.<br /><br />The film piles bad jokes one on top of the other and beats to death what wasn't particularly funny the first time -- the Italian chef who pines for Marty, the FBI agents' jokes about how hot Marty supposedly is, etc. I guess it does this because it has nothing else to do. There's just nothing going on here, no romance, almost no comedy, certainly no suspense, and we lost logic in the first five minutes. The only thing that can recommend this movie is seeing the crack-up of a once gifted actress. There's a certain fascination in that, Ryan's performance is a slow-moving train wreck. I hope she gets it together and comes back in better form next time.\n",

            "As many people know, George Lucas is most famous for the fact that he wrote a certain series of fantasy films. Most of those films certainly were a great achievement, but one thing that many Star Wars fans overlook is the other entries in Lucas' list of directorial credits; one of which is this film, American Graffiti. The movie tells the story of the last night in town for a bunch of school kids about to leave to go to college. Now, this might not seem like a great base for a classic movie to work from; and it isn't, it's the handling that makes it great. In spite of his latest batch of movies, Lucas has shown with this movie that he has the talent to create an innovative and groundbreaking movie in spite of the plot. It's this fact that made Star Wars work so well, and it's nice to see the same effort transplanted into an earlier film that doesn't have the special effects and grandiose that Star Wars had. The energy and vitality that Lucas gives his multiple stories makes for a great ride, and American Graffiti is a lot of fun throughout.<br /><br />The film is most notable for the way that it captures the American youth of the sixties. It benefits from a great soundtrack that adequately helps to achieve this, and includes the likes of Buddy Holly and The Beach Boys. The film takes place in one night, and makes use of a number of different characters and story lines; all of which are interesting and unique. A lot of which are also really funny, and this is where my favourite part of American Graffiti comes in. The film works because it's such a good time, and the way that Lucas shows us that ensures that we have just as good a time as the characters on screen are having. The events that befall the characters in the movie will no doubt touch a nerve with anyone that has gone through childhood - things such as splitting up with your girlfriend, to being forced into doing things that could get you into trouble...all the way to asking an adult to go into a store to buy alcohol for you are shown with great care, and show that Lucas obviously knew what he was doing when he took on this movie. On the whole...it's very good stuff indeed.\n",

            "**SPOILERS** A bloody shootout in a Mafia safe-house apartment results in the rip off of $300,000.00 from the mob's Harlam bank. It also cost the lives of seven people including two members of the Mafia Gennaro family. <br /><br />Old Don Gennaro, Frank Macetta, is worried about his operations in Harlem falling apart and has his young hot-shot and sadistic son-in-law Nick D'Salvio, Tony Franciosa,to get things back to normal. Nick starts by trying to get back the stolen loot with the help of the Mafia controlled Doc Johnson, Richard Ward,who runs their Harlem rackets. <br /><br />The three, who knocked off the mob's monthly take, Jim Harris Joe Logart & Henry Jackson, Paul Benjamin Ed Bernard & Antonio Fargas,are marked for death not only by the Mafia and the Jackson Harlem syndicate but by the NYPD. Not just for ripping off the mob but for the murder of two policemen who tried to stop the trio's getaway.<br /><br />Put in charge of the murder/robbery investigation is young and collage educated Let. Poke, Yaphet Kotto, which irritates the local police precincts Capt. Mattelli, Anthony Quinn, who feels he should be the one in charge. This causes friction not only between the two cops but the men of the 27th precinct who feel that Capt. Mattelli should run the investigation.<br /><br />During the movie Capt. Mattelli grudgingly accepts the decision of Let. Poke being put in charge over him since he's been compromised by taking graft from Johnson for years, that will only hamper finding the three hoods who ripped the Johnson/Mafia off. Capt. Mattelli also learns only to late that once your in the pay of the mob the only way you can get out, or retire, of that squalid arraignment is in a pine box.<br /><br />Extremely brutal crime/drama with two of the persons, Henry J. Jackson & Joe Logart, who dared to take the mob's ill-gotten gains ending up viciously tortured and murdered by the maniacal Nick D'Salvio, who took a sick and morbid glee in doing the two in. <br /><br />The third man, and head, of the group of robbers Jim Harris was a lot harder and far more dangerous nut to crack and find by Nick and his hoods. Tracked down in an abandoned building in West Harlem. Jim alone with his common-law wife Gloria,Norma Donaldson, begins to freak-out when he get's epileptic seizures with no medication on hand to relive them. This time thing don't go off that well for Nick and both the Mafia and Johnson mob, like it did with both Joe & Henry. By the time the shootout was over the entire block, where Jim was holding out in, was left shot up and demolished together with Jim Nick and Gloria.<br /><br />Superior crime/movie with a stand-out performance by a young, 34 at the time, Yaphet Kotto as Let. Poke who showed the overly brutal Capt. Mattelli that you don't get the same results in solving crimes with 1940's police tactics in the year 1972. Even more important it's a lot better to be an honest cop then a dirty one in both having a clear conscience and long lifespan.\n",

I have just finished seeing the movie in the theater and was moved more than any movie since Titanic. I am a very hard critic, I'll admit, but this was a gem among all the dull stones this year. It is not just the movie of the holiday season, it is a spectacular story. The parts of the movie that have been criticized, mainly by those that have yet to see the film, are easily negated by watching the movie. The story wasn't about Mr. Gardner and his wife/girlfriend-it was about him, his son, diligence, hope, happiness, and so much more. It is so refreshing to be inspired by a film again. There was plenty of chemistry between Gardner and his son. Will Smith can act. Like he says in the movie, and I'm paraphrasing, \"People will tell you that you can't do it because they can't.\" That's what I say to anyone who questions the writing or directing of this film. You mock what you cannot do yourself. This is utter brilliance, ten stars.\n",

            "A Nightmare on Elm Street part 2 Freddy's revenge<br /><br />May contain `spoilers'<br /><br />`Mommy, why can't Jesse wake up like everyone else ?'<br /><br />Firstly I'd like to say that I believe this to be the most underrated film in the series. Aside from the first film this is the only other from the series that I still like. As has been mentioned by other people, I think Freddy developed too much of a personality after this film, dispatching victims with comedic one-liners and more stylised, effects based death sequences. In this film his remains pretty much as he was in the first. In fact, probably a little darker.<br /><br />One of the main problems People seem to have with this film is the implied bisexuality of its main character. I personally think it gives the film an Unusual twist. To quote Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger) `Nightmare 2 is a very creepy, very kinky film. It reverses the first one - instead of having a teenage girl in jeopardy, we have a bisexual male, and this factor is exploited by Freddy. There's a lot of stuff implied with the S & M bar, stringing up the coach in the shower room bondage situation, and going to his boyfriends house for protection, the two of them take their clothes off as often as possible. All that adolescent mad teenage hormone stuff is explored, which of course Freddy is privy to'.<br /><br />I like the nightmare sequences in this film. To me they have a quality that rings truer to real nightmares than that of the ones in the other sequels. When Jesse (Mark Patton) first spies Freddy lurking in the back yard and then the basement being a prime example. The school bus at the start is also a classic and another that springs to mind is when Jesse awakes in his room to find it's become so hot that things around it like a vinyl record have begun to melt.<br /><br />The score is my personal favourite of the entire series. Christopher Young creates something very unusual using such bizarre sounds as whale calls to good effect. It is a complete departure from the cheesy synth score of the original and because it lacks that familiar piano motif that's heard in all the films, sets it apart much like the film itself.<br /><br />There's also some nice camera work in there to, the shot that follows Jesse as he arrives at school the morning after the murder of the coach is good. Though my favourite has to be the shot that takes us up from the basement (albeit rather poorly cut as you go through the basement door) swerving up the stairs and into Jesse's little sisters room. Freddy's face is never fully visible unlike in the other sequels. Which I always thought was the way it should be kept. We only ever really see his face in a neat shot behind the flames of the broken Barbeque during the pool party scene.<br /><br />The acting from all concerned is solid, Patton and Meryl Streep look-a-like Kim Myers (Lisa) the two leads being particularly good.<br /><br />The film does have plenty of flaws, certain effects shots are very badly rendered. Witness the budgie exploding for a prime example and the awful creatures in the boiler room towards the end of the film for others. There's a lot of plot holes and the ending is decidedly weak but over all I really like the film. A lot of people say it's the worst of the series but in my opinion if you prefer number's 5 or 6 to this you are missing the point. I'll go out on a limb and say it's my personal favourite.<br /><br />7 ½ / 10<br /><br />\n",

            "I have often imagined how the film of William Gibson's brilliant cyberpunk short story of corporate espionage and betrayal could be made. I pictured how I would do it in my head, but I didn't know if there was enough substance in the story for a complete two hour movie. After several directors tried and failed to get the film financed, Abel Ferrara was finally the one to make it. He succeeds in developing the gloss and style necessary to create the atmosphere of debauchery and intrigue at the heart of the short story, but style is skin deep and becomes a very weak means to an end. Once the movie moves out of the whorehouse and into the plot, it disappears into a morass of visual stylistics and a wasted half-hour of reiterated images that have no meaning and no impact. For a similar treatment of film-making, a viewer could avail themselves of Dennis Hopper's dreadful 'The Last Movie'.<br /><br />I will give Mr. Ferrara credit where it is due with his film - he creates a very evocative and sensual Tokyo underworld, and gets a strong performance from Christopher Walken as Fox, the head of a syndicate that is going to seduce and snatch the world's top genetic biologist from one mega-corporation to work for another. The exposition, which is long and luxurious, also brings in the tool for the seduction - a young Italian harlot named Sandii (Asia Argento), whose pouty lips, sensuously unkempt hair and beautiful body will be the tool to lure the scientist from his 'ball-busting' wife and displeasure with his current position. She is trained well - the scientist Hiroshi is protected by his employer and it will take extra skills to earn his defection. Everybody will earn big bucks to bring this brain over. Walken effortlessly explains the plot and invites the girl in, although she has been sleeping with his associate X (Willem Dafoe). Dafoe is in on the deal, but is also falling in love with Sandii, even though he knows she is prone to lying about almost everything.<br /><br />From the point their plot starts to go into action (about the 40-minute mark) Ferrara's instincts go all wrong. Rather than following Sandii into the heart of the seduction, we are kept at a distance - the information about their success/failure is relayed through an exasperating series of off-kilter video images which worked in the whorehouse environment but do not work here, flashing back to Fox strutting around crowing and $100,000,000 being put into their account for the success of their mission. But then, without adding excessive spoilers, there is a terrible betrayal, everything goes wrong, and they wind up on the lam, with X hiding out at the New Rose Hotel. He crawls into his tiny concrete berth in this Tokyo hotel at around the 60 minute mark in the movie and does not leave. At this point the short story ends with a perfunctory sentence or two, but here Ferrara's narrative goes all awry. He expendes another half hour explaining the roots of the betrayal for those daft enough not to understand it the first time. There's nothing like taking a 60-minute movie and then turning it into a 90-minute movie by replaying clips from the first 60 minutes for half an hour. There were so many fade-outs during this time that at least 4 times I expected to start seeing credits, only to drop my jaw as we get another scene of Dafoe in bed with Argento. It was flabbergastingly bad film-making of the sort expected from subsidized European productions, and Dafoe was simply not up to emoting X's desperation, fear and hopeless longing.<br /><br />Ferrara's stylistics at the beginning of the film lead one to expect something much better, but his narrative sense fails him completely. I give it three out of ten - pluses for eroticism and bare bones atmosphere, a zero for anything past the 50-minute mark.\n",

            "What can I say? This is a wonderful, gentle film, the kind, sadly, Hollywood no longer makes. I saw it first twenty years ago, and it haunted me ever since; I try to watch it once every couple of years. Fontaine and Cotten are in top form here, as are all the supporting actors (especially Tandy). The plot is absolute escapist romantic fare, which I'll leave others to describe. While on the surface the main catch may seem far-fetched, it's handled with surprising credibility; one cannot help but feel caught up in the lovers' dilemma. Given their once-in-a-million opportunity, would any of us have done anything different? Can we judge them? <br /><br />But, despite the outstanding acting and story, the real stars here are the music and the Italian settings. The haunting song \"September Affair,\" played in the film, was recorded shortly before Walter Huston's death and released posthumously; the poignancy of this fact, and the skillful usage in the film, made both a huge sensation. The captivating black-and-white Italian scenery, especially in Rome and Capri (check out the awesome sequence in the cave at Capri) is worth watching just by itself - much of the same would be captured later in Technicolor (but not as effectively) in the film Rome Adventure. An unforgettable viewing experience; if you love escapism and romance, don't miss this one.\n",

            "Plot of this somewhat engaging loincloth romp: girl beats boy, boy beats girl, enlightenment, happy ever after. And if you can't follow the plot, don't worry, because the Worst Narrator of All Time will be happy to spell it out for you.<br /><br />After her mother is clubbed one time too many by her caveman domestic abuser, Tigri and her gal pals take to the jungle with their pet panther and \"the Wise One\" (an irritating old crone). There they mature into leggy swimsuit models and \"dance restlessly\" \"without knowing why\", although we know why, and it has something to do with Loincloth Boy and his rugged pals, with whom and their ilk the lonesome doves have had nothing to do these many moons.<br /><br />There is some marginally amusing reversal-of-sexes stuff as the gals club the caveboys into submission, but the tables are soon turned. Before we get too far into male dominance a visit from a pelican/ugly puppet, followed by a giant, nicely resolves our conflict.<br /><br />The outstandingly Bad aspect of this otherwise modestly bad film is the narration. The dialog is spoken entirely in Cave-ese, which we moderns of course do not understand, so a helpful narrator is along to fill us in. Unfortunately in addition to translating the dialog the narrator insists on telling us WHAT WE HAVE JUST SEEN, EACH AND EVERY TIME, so that the entire movie consists of the viewer watching things like: the girls gesture at the guys to pick up a dead panther, whereupon the narrator solemnly intones in his best pear-shaped tones: \"and the women force the men to carry the panther back to their jungle home\", which of course is WHAT WE WERE JUST LOOKING AT. Since the narrator continues to state the bleeding obvious throughout the entire flick from beginning to end, it draws the viewer out of the story and into an \"I can't believe how stupid this is\" state of mind.<br /><br />However there are people who take pleasure in doing exactly this, and for such people this is an under-appreciated candidate for Worst Film of All Time lists. I recommend it highly.\n",

            "This pretends to be a sequel to the superb American Psycho. It isn't. it's an insult. It simply exploits a spurious association and in so doing drags down the earlier work.<br /><br />Right from the very start to the very last second we are hammered with the leaden narration of the lead character, nothing is left for us to see. It might as well be a \"talking book for the visually impaired\". Maybe the director is visually impaired: how else does he fail to see the absurdity of the illustration on the cover of a book about a murder being a photo taken a few minutes after the incident for which there were only three witnesses without a photographer among them?<br /><br />The plot makes no sense. Sure, the stolen identity idea works, just about, but even that falls apart when we consider that college records usually include photos of the students. What is worse is that the narrator tells us she kept quiet about seeing a murder to avoid years of therapy, then goes to a therapist anyway, doesn't actually tell him anything, but invests great effort in inspiring fear in him, a character who had no relevance whatever to the protagonists plans. Except that, coincidentally, he happens to be the professors friend. Which suggests that this entire chunk of the plot is simply a cack-handed way of tacking-on an external viewpoint to the professors death. How incompetent a method of storytelling is that?<br /><br />In a work where it is used to serious effect we might tolerate the gross and extreme violence that begin with the very first frame ( a severed head ). But in this context, a ridiculous piece of chirpy teen-twaddle, that explicit violence becomes offensive. <br /><br />Speaking of teen-twaddle, the music is unremittingly awful throughout. Apart from the incidental score. But hang on, how come the movie's own incidental music is actually playing on the girls car radio? Remember, she actually turns it's volume up! This detail is a POS of the highest order.<br /><br />Tip: Morgan Freeman, stick to \"acting\", I mean, smoking cigars and looking soulful!\n",

Considering the technical limitations of film-making in 1932, the photography and special effects are quite good: the whirlpool, the erupting volcano and the river of lava.<br /><br />Contradicting other postings to this website, I did not see a \"rape\" scene. What I saw was the male lead chase the female lead after she had been teasing him, then he wrestled her and pinned her down to introduce her to Western-style kissing. A rapist doesn't kiss his victim, and a rape victim would not want her attacker to continue kissing her.<br /><br />The action of the plot moves quickly and is never bogged down by the dialog.

            "Here is another film of which I knew nothing that - thanks to the recommendation of my video service - has brought two intensely entertaining and thought-provoking hours to my life. It comprises three tales of the worldwide AIDS epidemic each unique and impressive.<br /><br />The first takes place in rural China where Lucy Liu plays Jin Ping - a woman who is a black-marketeer of blood products. She and her partners prey upon residents of small villages who are basically ignorant of the complexities and dangers involved in donating blood. The villagers are poor, and the promise of much-needed funds is the bait used by Jin Ping. A farmer who is unable to give blood uses his daughter as the donor in order to make a better life for his family. The farmer and his daughter are played by two extraordinary Chinese actors who bring humor and - in the end - great pathos to their parts. In this first of the three parts the film shows ruin and death brought to an entire village through greed and apathy.<br /><br />The second tale narrower in scope but is the most fascinating of the three. It takes place in French-Canada and revolves around a porn star and his family. Stockard Channing plays the mother in what is one of the strangest and most fascinating roles I have ever seen. To tell more would spoil the film for anyone who might view it, but I can assure you that Channing has accomplished something special in her portrayal of a mother's reaction to the illness of her son.<br /><br />The third story in the film stars Olympia Dukakis, Chloë Sevigny, and Sandra Oh as nuns who travel to Africa to assist at a clinic. They become involved in various ways with the workers and the large agricultural company for which most of the local villagers work. In this third tale the scenery is so beautiful and impressive that it is almost beyond comprehension. The viewer is struck that within all of this natural beauty, lurks a deadly disease destroying the population.<br /><br />In most films in which the driving theme is the destructiveness of AIDS, you would expect to see at least some characters who are gay men. There is not one gay person in this film. That very fact enhances the film's powerful message that this epidemic is not one confined to a small segment of society but to the world's civilization as a whole. If you wish to observe disease, religion, avarice, politics, love, hate and still be thoroughly entertained, I recommend 3 Needles.\n",

            "I'm always very cautious when people refer to the genuine brilliance of Asian horror productions (as I've been let down one too many times), but in the case of \"ThreeExtremes\" every single word of praise is more than justified! This movie is bound to make an everlasting impression on you, and most likely that impression will either be fear, disturbance or just plain repulsion(but the 'good' kind of repulsion). The format of a horror anthology isn't very common in Asian cinema, at least not that I'm aware of, but these three directors approach the format with the exact right attitude. There's no silly and overlong wraparound, the stories just follow each other without necessarily featuring common themes or characters. This results in three versatile stories, covering completely different horror styles. The first story by Fruit Chan aims at pure controversial shocks, with its plot about an ageing actress who desperately wants to maintain her good looks and young skin and therefore consults the mysterious \"Aunt Mei\". Her secret of eternal youth involves serving her customers dumpling-dishes made of  hold on to your socks for this  aborted human fetuses! Mrs. Li is very pleased with the results at first, but then gets sick after finishing a 'meal' made of the leftovers of an incest baby. Fruit Chan is the least famous director of the bunch, but his is definitely a name to remember and keep an eye on. The style of \"Dumplings\" is extremely brutal and nihilistic. People talk about the abortion of living creatures like it's the most normal thing in the world and the camera regularly zooms in on how aunt Mai professionally grinds the baby-flesh. Admittedly, you require a strong stomach to endure the make-up effects in this first episode, but even more disturbing is Chan's use of freaky sounds. The music is downright nightmarish and particularly the chewing-noises, made when Mrs. Lee eats the dumplings, sent cold shivers down my spine. Chan-Wook Park is responsible for the second tale and if you've seen any of the entries in his Vengeance-Trilogy (\"Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance\", \"Oldboy\", \"Lady Vengeance\"), you already more or less know what to expect. Namely a cruel and relentless tale of violence that brings out the absolute darkest side of the human mind. Chan-Wook Park is a genius when it comes to the drawing of his characters and he once more demonstrates that here, with his story about the home jacking of a famous director and his vain wife by a severely frustrated walk-on actor. The wife is imaginatively tied between the walls and her piano and the perpetrator threatens to cut off her fingers, unless the director has the courage to strangle a little girl the stranger kidnapped as well. The seemly honest and friendly couple gradually turn into selfish and aggressive monsters the more their lives become endangered. \"Cut\" is probably my favorite segment of all three! The tension is almost unbearable and you just know Chan-Wook Park isn't going to come up with a happy ending! People are crazy, evil bastards that only look after themselves and that's the ONLY message to communicate here. His segment also contains the most violent and gory images, as the house's artsy floor is literally flooded with blood near the end of the story. \"Cut\" is a harrowing piece of cult cinema that only confirms that Chan-Wook Park is a brilliant director. Die-hard fans of Takashi Miike that are expecting a short movie similar to \"Itchi the Killer\" or \"Fûdoh\" will be quite amazed that his contribution to \"ThreeExtremes\" is the most atmospheric and suggestive one! \"Box\" is a complex little mind-bender that is low on graphic violence and shocks, but nevertheless very intense and petrifying. The tale centers on a young woman experiencing nightmares about her childhood life as a circus artist. The competitive relationship with her twin-sister eventually led to unwanted murder and now the unfortunate girl comes back to haunt her. In all honesty I must admit I enjoyed \"Box\" the least, mainly because the complete change in tone and filming style came too unexpectedly. Miike puts a whole lot of haunting images in his film, but the plot is too abstract and raises too many questions for which there are no answers. Great ending, though. My guess is that Miike was merely using this omnibus job to experiment with horror styles and elements that are new for him. \"ThreeExtremes\" is a tremendously marvelous film that every horror fanatic has to see for him/herself! And that recommendation comes from someone who totally disliked the so-called Asian horror masterpieces \"Ringu\", \"Ju-On The Grudge\" and \"The Eye\".\n",

Because some of the cops looked alike and because the filmmakers only attempted to explain half of an interconnected story in order to preserve the final surprise element, I wound up confused in the beginning (until they make it totally obvious that Hauer is being set up).<br /><br />Hauer is Nick Randall, a slick bounty hunter who is visited by Philmore Walker, an old partner (Robert Gillaume), who persuades Randall to take on a risky job involving Arab terrorists (I think they need the feds, not one bounty hunter for a job of this size). Only problem is, that Walker is in cahoots with the city police officials are actually working with the terrorists to bring Randall down. In constructing the story, the filmmakers try too hard to make some of it, but not enough of it known (at least sequentially), and for me at least, it turned out to be a difficult mess to sort through (again, until they make it obvious through at least half of the second act). Furthermore, there just wasn't enough develop among the characters (possibly, because there are too many people involved) that you never really get a real sense of anything.<br /><br />The only saving grace, however, are the action sequences.

The film also known in another name as Last line of defence 2 an apparant sequal to another film Gruner was in as the lead as a different character. What is the point? the first which I have not seen is apparantly about an alien or something, this is completley different featuring a story about a disgraced army guy (can't remeber who he worked for) who needs to rasie 5 million for a special new cancer treatment that will save his son and other children. Michael Ironside plays a wealthy business man who is of course a dirty scoundral who is swimming in dirty ill-gotten money. He laughs at Dan Andersons character and refuses to give it. Dan decides to steal it from him with the help of some ex colleagues from the special forces and his new workmates in his office job. This film looks painfully cheap throughout, no explosions barely any action of which is wafer thin, with little special effects such as squibs and bullet holes neccassary to add depth to any action scene and fight choreography is uninspired as is the fact that there seems to be not one good stunt. All action flicks from the bid busdgets to home movies should have some sort of dangerous stunt in it. Dan Anderson is bad, I doubt he will evr work again, he can't act, I see no sign of any fighting ability, he is nothing more than a beefy bloke who has been scraped from the bottom of the action barrell. So many people could have been cast here, you look at the amount of actionb stars there are out there, even the like of Don the Dragon and Gary Daniels, Billy Blanks can act better than this guy plus they are all martial artists. The best acting in this probably comes from Gruner which is saying something, Madson and Ironside are wasted but are merely coasting through happy to pick up there cheques for minimal effort. The possibilities the plot had are wasted, the script is poor and the direction flat, there is nothing to hold your attention, certainly not the painfully wooden Anderson who is either an Ex-American football player or a stunt man turned actor. He's bid but in no way looks bad, he just doesn't have an action man look of toughness he can give out,Gruner has this and it makes you think he would have been so much better in the lead. Why in all honesty they made this movie is beyond me it is so uninspired. I have been tricked. The cover of the DVD I rented has Gruner, Madsen and Ironside on the front so I naturally thought this was an Olivier flick, by this fact I wasn't expecting too much but I was shocked at the appalling use of mis-advertising. 2/10 (the two is for idea, but there are no marks for the execution)\n",

Both of these scenes are in perfect sync (probably Vitaphone--sounds like disc surface noise). You can usually tell the \"sound stage sound\" as opposed to studio sound added later.<br /><br />The reason for these two short sequences is probably because the film was filmed \"on location\" in the Pacific. At that time, location sound recording would have not been practical. The scenes were most likely shot on a sound stage at M-G-M. Many silents were still in production in 1929. Adding sound sequences, or \"goat glands\", as they were called, was a transitional way of making silents \"part-talkies\", as referred by Photoplay magazine.\n",

            "For the particular movie fan, The Beat That My Heart Skipped, is a slice of intensity, wonder, and subtlety that can only come from Europe. The director/co-writer, Jacques Audiard, has taken a film previously made by James Toback called Fingers, starring Harvey Keitel in the role now occupied by Romain Duris, and made it his own. If I had seen the original version I would make a couple of comparisons to it (at the least, for those who didn't see the original the remake makes you want to check out the original, if only for the acting appeal of Keitel). However I did think about another wonderful French film in the vein of this film- Francois Truffaut's Shoot the Piano Player.<br /><br />While Truffaut's film is a little more concerned about the lead's relationship(s) with women, I felt a kind of connection between the material of the two pieces- sometimes intense, usually lyrical, tales of a person trying to find what fits more for them, the more criminal side, or the artistic side. And, much like Truffaut and his other New-Wave counterparts, Audiard successfully takes an American formula picture and forms it well into a French setting.<br /><br />There are a few reasons to recommend the movie, one would be for the music, which gives repeated but specific renditions of a Bach tune. Another would be just for the technical-side, which is well-done in hand-held, neo-noir style by Stephane Fontaine. Another could even just be for how Audiard tells his story, or sometimes doesn't tell it: a couple of times mid-way through the film, I wondered if the story of this character would 'go' anywhere, which can either make or break a film of this kind. It pleasantly (or intensely) did, bringing a catharsis for a viewer by the final scenes.<br /><br />But likely for most the prominent reason would be for the realistic acting, in particular by its star Duris. As I said, I can't make comparisons between a heavyweight like Keitel and Duris (whom I've never seen in a film before this), but on his own terms Duris creates his character believably. It's at times a complex character, or sometimes not- he has that kind of attitude and face where you don't know whether he's really a 'street-level' guy or more straight laced. The split that is also apparent in the character's parents, one a classic pianist who's passed on (the mother), and the other a more criminal-type of a father, also gives the film an added boost of psychological energy. The lead in this film, much like with the storytelling (or lack of it), dictates how it may turn out.<br /><br />In the end, Audiard and Duris make it compelling enough for the film to be about him, his conflicts, his lusts, his music. It's a wonderful movie that seems to have passed under the radar (it's in only a few theaters around the area) amid other independent summer fare, but if you're an enthusiast of character-driven thrillers that give a bitter-sweet edge, it's a must-see.\n",

            "I absolutely loved Highlander part I, but when I saw this movie, I didn't understand the story at all! I've seen it more than once, just to make sure I wasn't crazy, but I still don't get it.<br /><br />spoilers coming your way!!!<br /><br />In H1 it was all pretty normal. Okay, so it's a story written with a lot of imagination, but you could understand it. In H2, everything changes and Conner and ramirez show up somewhere out of space and must return to earth to save the planet. First, I never heard ANYTHING of them leaving earth and second, wasn't Ramirez killed in part 1???!!!??? And another thing, what was that with Conner having to become immortal once again? I didn't get that part, call me crazy if you want to.<br /><br />Oh yeah, for all those who have also seen part 3, I think there's a huge mistake made in 2 and 3. Conner's wife from part 1 dies two times! First in part 2, because of the ozon-thing and in part 3 they mention that his wife had to be scraped of off the road in Scotland somewhere.<br /><br />speaking about part 3... This was a Very good part. Okay, it wasn't as good as part 1, but it made sense (besides the power thing that immortals suddenly owned).<br /><br />\n",

            "When Trey Parker and Matt Stone were writing the script for the movie, they had to make a decision if they wanted to \"dumb down\" material for the non-fans. Instead, they decided to make this movie for the fans-and by God, this has got to be one of the funniest movies I have seen all decade. There was never a dull moment, the audience was uproarious, and I was laughing harder than I have in years.<br /><br />Even going as far as to top There's Something About Mary in its crudeness and extreme vulgarity, South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut does what few TV-to-movies do: make a jump to the next level by pushing the obscenity to the limit.<br /><br />I'll try and not spoil too much. The four kids go to see the Terrance & Phillip movie, \"Asses of Fire.\" There is a musical number featured in the movie-within-a-movie which had the audience rolling, the lyrics consisting almost entirely of the f-word (and the TV show's bleeps are discarded for the film). The boys soak in the movie's naughty language and come out spouting forbidden obscenities. Soon other children see the movie. In the school classroom, there is an eruption of swearing and the boys are sent to the school guidance counselor, Mr. Mackey, who calls in their mothers to make them aware of what the Terrance & Phillip movie has done to the kids. They form The Mothers Against Canada and try to have Terrance & Phillip executed. Canada defends its humor while the United States laughs at them, and Canada retaliates by bombing the Baldwin brothers (very clever). Soon Canada and the U.S. are engaging in full-scale war.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Kenny dies (not surprisingly) and goes to Hell, where Saddam Hussein and Satan are in a homosexual love affair. Saddam only wants sex every five minutes and Satan wants to be loved. Their scenes in bed are a reason why kids should not see this movie. Back on Earth, the kids form a group to save Terrance & Phillip, \"La Resistance\" (obviously paying homage to Les Misérables) and make a plan to rescue Terrance & Phillip from the big USO show, where they are to executed. Guests at the USO meeting include Big Gay Al and Winona Ryder (who is happy to demonstrate her famous \"ping-pong ball\" trick). The kids attempt to sneak into the show and free Terrance & Phillip.<br /><br />This movie will shock you. You will not believe some of the jokes in this movie. It will offend many people. The film takes equal shots at Jews, blacks, Canadians, Bill Gates, and Jar Jar Binks, to name a few. I'm quite sure many will be offended by \"The Mole\" character and what the military's plans are for the 14th battalion (snicker).<br /><br />Fans will undoubtably love this movie. We finally see Kenny without his parka and hear him speak, and there's none of those annoying bleeps. I am a fan. I loved it. In fact, I'm going as far as to recommend it as a candidate for one of the best of 1999, let alone best comedy of the decade. This movie is non-stop laughs and it's very, very entertaining. It's not all toilet humor, either. The creators manage to get a message through, and there are large satirical tones concerning our modern society.<br /><br />I paused while writing my review to consider people who aren't fans of the show and what they will think, and I have kept those in mind. There is a lot of swearing and a lot of frankly gratuitous sexual material. I salute Trey Parker and Matt Stone for having the guts to push the R rating to its boundaries. This film is fun for movie buffs and those who love political humor. And so, I am awarding it four stars. In these trying times, we need a good laugh or two.\n",

            "This is a silent film with a heavy overlay of narration, provided by several of its fictional characters, and a cool musical soundtrack illegally swiped from LPs. A short list of composers whose works are featured in 4-D WITCH includes: Mussorgsky (\"Night on Bald Mountain\"), Wagner (the finale of TRISTAN UND ISOLDE, scored for piano and orchestra), Rimsky-Korsakov (\"Scheherazade\"), and Pink Floyd (the 1968 studio version of \"Saucerful of Secrets\").<br /><br />Basically, 4-D WITCH is just a series of erotic events strung together by narrators. I enjoyed the narration of \"Cindy,\" the central character whose flirtation with sexual witchcraft gives the movie its focus. Whoever provided her voice did a great job characterizing Cindy as a \"game young innocent.\" Dial enough 1-900 numbers and you may get to speak with her yourself.<br /><br />Visually, 4-D WITCH is a mess, with psychedelic light shows, bizarre superimposed images of masks and frightening faces, and occasional straight shots of the characters that serve as \"establishing shots\" for the special effects. Everybody seems caught up in a psychic whirlpool, from which the only way out is down, down, down. <br /><br />Despite its interesting and amusing elements, the film's amateurish editing, the incoherence of the \"plot\" and the random/shuffle nature of the soundtrack all help 4-D WITCH to overstay its welcome long before the final reel starts rolling. The abrupt, unresolved ending would be confusing, were it not a great relief! Someone should convert 4-D WITCH into a \"loop\" and send it to Abu Ghraib, where it can be put to its best possible use.\n",

            "'Papillon' tells one of those stories that we remember for a long time. It is the tale of one man's life, an unbreakable friendship, and an inability to accept defeat against impossible odds. The film was based on the memoirs of convicted French felon Henri Charrière (though several critics have expressed doubt over the factual accuracy of the described events), who spent many years incarcerated in the brutal penal settlement of mainland French Guiana. The film was adapted by Dalton Trumbo and Lorenzo Semple Jr., and directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, who is most well-known for 'The Planet of the Apes (1968)' and 'Patton (1970).' Steve McQueen delivers a formidable performance as the convict Charriere, nicknamed \"Papillon\" because of the butterfly tattoo on his chest. Claiming to have been framed in the murder of a pimp, Papillon seeks immediately to escape from his imprisonment, employing the services  and later the friendship  of the withdrawn and vulnerable, but nonetheless resourceful, Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman).<br /><br />One element that 'Papillon' accomplishes so powerfully is the torture and suffering that takes place in the prison. The bodies of exhausted and wasted men litter the paths, and most inmates have grown so accustomed to the prospect of death that they greet each carcass with a painful indifference. After a failed escape attempt, Papillon is sentenced to two years in solitary confinement, a truly horrific punishment with the sole aim of crushing the prisoner's spirit and sanity. Despite a few inexperienced dream sequences, this segment of the film is handled masterfully, and McQueen excels, deteriorating into the jittery, wide-eyed, physically-drained shell of a human being who has only a paper-thin grasp on both life and reality. A remarkable thing about Dustin Hoffman is that I've never seen him play the same character, and Louis Dega is no exception. Beneath his thick-lensed spectacles and shy countenance lies a true friend; one who, despite their differences, will risk everything to repay a good deed once done.<br /><br />During the last third of 'Papillon', not including the final act, Schaffner veers slightly away from the touching human friendship story and descends into above-average adventure mode, which was interesting but not on par with the rest of the film. Though it appeared in Charrière's original novel, the ill-developed (and dialogue-sparse) sub-plot of the brave white man earning the admiration of the natives was a Hollywood cliché that I could have done without. Additionally, a wonderful ending was tarnished somewhat by an unnecessary few lines of closing narration. It would have been much more effective had Papillon's fate been left open to the audiences. Of course, the fact that the writers were working off a true story perhaps makes that idea completely redundant. Nevertheless, 'Papillon' is a magnificently memorable prison drama, with two outstanding central performances (neither of which, I was shocked to discover, were nominated for an Oscar). The film's themes  of an innocent man finding the courage, hope and friendship to survive the horrific treatment of a cruel prison system  almost certainly served as inspiration for Frank Darabont's 'The Shawshank Redemption (1994).'\n",

            "Like many screen adaptations of Christie novels, THE MIRROR CRACK'D features an all-star cast--and in this case the casting would seem inspired: Angela Lansbury as Miss Marple, Rock Hudson as a film producer, Elizabeth Taylor as his movie-star wife, Kim Novack as a rival screen queen, and Tony Curtis as Novak's lover and the producer of the film they are all making. But director Guy Hamilton is more interested in having his cast offer star turns than in actually serving the story, and the result is a strangely uneven, extremely plodding film that only comes to life when Taylor and Novak square off in the series of hilariously written and performed cat-fights that run throughout the movie.<br /><br />Part of the problem lies in the source material. THE MIRROR CRACK'D is one of Christie's lesser novels, written in a very sparse style and lacking Christie's usual knock-out solution in its story of a fan who drops dead of poisoning at a film star's reception. In order to flesh out the tale, the script piles extraneous scene upon extraneous scene--with the Taylor-Novak scenes a case in point: enjoyable as they are, they actually have little to do with the story and so tend to slow the film down. To make matters worse, the performances are extremely casual at best. Taylor and Novak are extremely enjoyable in their scenes together--but elsewhere they are merely adequate. Hudson and Curtis are flat. And Angela Lansbury, a normally brilliant actress, has one of her rare failures with the role of Jane Marple.<br /><br />At most, this film is for viewers who want to be in on the last major cinematic gasps of Taylor, Novak, Hudson, and Curtis--and those who derive a certain joy from evaluating the level of decay seen here in the aging cast. Regretfully, this is particularly true of Taylor, who is... shall we say... extremely ample. And most will enjoy seeing Taylor and Novak flog each other with nasty one-liners delivered with considerable flair. But cat-fight scenes aside, THE MIRROR CRACK'D is just one very mild meow.<br /><br />Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer\n",
